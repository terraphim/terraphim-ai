# X (Twitter) Marketing Thread

## Main Tweet (Thread Starter)

Introducing Terraphim AI: Your privacy-first AI assistant that searches across ALL your knowledge sources - local files, Notion, Obsidian, GitHub, StackOverflow - without sending data to the cloud.

Here's why we're building X API integration... [Thread]

The problem: Your knowledge is scattered everywhere.

- Personal notes in Obsidian
- Team docs in Confluence
- Code in GitHub
- Discussions on X/Twitter

Workers waste 20% of their time just FINDING information. That's 1 full day per week.

Current AI assistants require uploading your data to third-party servers.

Terraphim runs 100% locally. Your private conversations, proprietary code, and confidential documents stay on YOUR machine.

Privacy isn't optional. It's the foundation.

Why X API integration matters:

X is where technical discussions happen in real-time. Bug solutions, architecture debates, breaking changes - all shared in threads.

But X search is limited. We want to index YOUR relevant technical X conversations into your local knowledge graph.

## Tweet 5

Imagine searching "how to handle async cancellation in Rust" and getting:

- Your local notes
- Your team's Confluence docs
- Relevant StackOverflow answers
- AND that brilliant thread from @rust_daily you bookmarked 6 months ago

All from one local search. All private.

Technical highlights:

- Knowledge graph with semantic search (not just keyword matching)
- BM25, TitleScorer, and graph-based ranking algorithms
- Multiple scoring functions for personalized relevance
- Sub-2 second Firecracker VM boot for secure execution
- OpenRouter + Ollama for local LLM support

## Tweet 7

Current integrations:

- Local filesystem (Markdown, code)
- Notion, Obsidian, Logseq
- Confluence, Jira, SharePoint
- StackOverflow, GitHub, Reddit
- Email via JMAP
- MCP (Model Context Protocol)

X API would unlock social knowledge discovery.

What X integration would enable:

- Index bookmarked technical threads
- Track discussions from accounts you follow
- Build thesaurus from domain-specific X conversations
- Connect X insights to your local knowledge graph
- Semantic search across your X history

All stored locally.
