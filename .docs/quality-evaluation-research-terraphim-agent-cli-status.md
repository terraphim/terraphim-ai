# Quality Evaluation: Research - Terraphim Agent & CLI Status Check

**Document Type**: Research Document
**Phase Transition**: Phase 1 -> Phase 2
**Status**: CONDITIONAL PASS
**Evaluator**: pi
**Date**: 2026-02-10

## Executive Summary

The research document is clear, well-structured, and grounded in code evidence. It meets the minimum KLS thresholds and essentialism checks, but requires explicit stakeholder review/approval before proceeding to implementation planning beyond documentation work.

## KLS Dimension Scores

| Dimension | Score | Justification | Required Fix |
|-----------|-------|---------------|--------------|
| Physical | 4/5 | Well-formatted with headings, tables, and clear sections. | None |
| Empirical | 4/5 | Uses consistent terminology and concrete references to code locations. | None |
| Syntactic | 4/5 | Follows the research template and is internally consistent. | None |
| Semantic | 4/5 | Accurately reflects current code and dependencies. | None |
| Pragmatic | 3/5 | Actionable next steps exist, but concrete validation evidence is pending. | Add planned smoke-test evidence once executed. |
| Social | 3/5 | Reviewers listed as TBD; no explicit stakeholder sign-off. | Obtain stakeholder review/approval. |

**Average Score**: 3.7/5
**Minimum Score**: 3/5 (Pragmatic, Social)

## Essentialism Evaluation

| Check | Status | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Vital Few Focus (<=5 items) | Pass | 3 essential constraints listed. |
| Eliminated Noise | Pass | “Eliminated from Scope” section present. |
| Effortless Path | Pass | Recommendation is limited to documentation + smoke tests. |
| 90% Rule | Pass | Scope is narrow and directly tied to the request. |

## Decision

**GO/NO-GO**: CONDITIONAL PASS

**Rationale**: Meets quality thresholds but requires stakeholder approval and empirical validation once smoke tests are run.

### Recommended Actions (if CONDITIONAL PASS)
1. Obtain stakeholder review/approval for the research doc.
2. Add evidence from smoke tests once executed.

## Re-Evaluation

After fixes are applied:
- [ ] Stakeholder approval recorded
- [ ] Smoke test evidence appended (if executed)
- [ ] Re-score pragmatic/social dimensions
