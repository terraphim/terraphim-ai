# Quality Evaluation: Design - Terraphim Agent & CLI Status Assessment

**Document Type**: Implementation Plan
**Phase Transition**: Phase 2 -> Phase 3
**Status**: CONDITIONAL PASS
**Evaluator**: pi
**Date**: 2026-02-10

## Executive Summary

The implementation plan is concise, scoped, and aligned with essentialism. It is sufficient for a documentation-driven status assessment but requires explicit approval to proceed and confirmation that smoke tests are acceptable as the only validation.

## KLS Dimension Scores

| Dimension | Score | Justification | Required Fix |
|-----------|-------|---------------|--------------|
| Physical | 4/5 | Clear structure with tables and step-by-step plan. | None |
| Empirical | 4/5 | Understandable to CLI stakeholders; terminology matches existing tooling. | None |
| Syntactic | 4/5 | Complete sections and consistent scope definition. | None |
| Semantic | 4/5 | Accurately reflects current CLI architecture and constraints. | None |
| Pragmatic | 3/5 | Actionable plan but depends on manual smoke tests and approvals. | Confirm smoke tests scope is acceptable. |
| Social | 3/5 | Approval checklist is empty; stakeholder sign-off pending. | Obtain stakeholder approval. |

**Average Score**: 3.7/5
**Minimum Score**: 3/5 (Pragmatic, Social)

## Essentialism Evaluation

| Check | Status | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Vital Few Focus (<=5 items) | Pass | Plan covers 4 steps with limited scope. |
| Eliminated Noise | Pass | Out-of-scope and avoid list included. |
| Effortless Path | Pass | No new features or refactors proposed. |
| 90% Rule | Pass | Only essential status checks are included. |

## Decision

**GO/NO-GO**: CONDITIONAL PASS

**Rationale**: Plan is sound but requires explicit approval and agreement on smoke-test-only validation.

### Recommended Actions (if CONDITIONAL PASS)
1. Record stakeholder approval for the plan.
2. Confirm smoke test list and any required coverage additions.

## Re-Evaluation

After fixes are applied:
- [ ] Approvals recorded
- [ ] Pragmatic/social dimensions re-scored
