## ðŸ§ª How Routing Works

### 1. Task Analysis
The system analyzes multiple factors to determine complexity:

- **Content Length**: Word count and sentence structure
- **Technical Features**: Keywords like "authentication", "payment", "API"
- **Template Complexity**: Base complexity varies by prototype type
- **Requirements Sophistication**: Mobile, responsive, interactive elements

### 2. Model Selection Algorithm
```javascript
// Complexity scoring (0.0 - 1.0)
complexity = baseComplexity + contentFactors + technicalFeatures

// Model routing logic
if (complexity <= 0.6) â†’ GPT-3.5 Turbo (Fast, $0.002/1k)
if (complexity <= 0.9) â†’ GPT-4 (Advanced, $0.03/1k)
if (complexity = 1.0) â†’ Claude 3 Opus (Expert, $0.075/1k)
```

### 3. Quality-Cost Balance
- **Simple Tasks**: Route to faster, cheaper models
- **Complex Tasks**: Route to more capable, expensive models
- **Automatic Optimization**: Best model for the job without manual selection

    if (wordCount > 100) complexity += 0.2;
    if (wordCount > 200) complexity += 0.2;

    // Feature detection
    complexity += featureMatches * 0.1;

    // Technical requirements
    if (hasResponsive) complexity += 0.1;
    if (hasInteractive) complexity += 0.15;

    return Math.min(1.0, complexity);
  }
}
```

### Model Configuration
```javascript
models = [
  {
    id: 'openai_gpt35',
    name: 'GPT-3.5 Turbo',
    maxComplexity: 0.6,
    cost: 0.002,
    speed: 'Fast'
  },
  // Additional models...
