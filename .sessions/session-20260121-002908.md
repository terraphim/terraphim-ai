## Progress Log


## Verification Results

### Working Features

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `cargo build --workspace` | Working | Builds all crates successfully |
| `cargo build -p terraphim_agent --features repl-full` | Working | TUI with all features |
| `terraphim-agent --help` | Working | Shows all commands |
| `terraphim-agent guard` | Working | Blocks destructive git commands |
| `terraphim-agent replace` | Working | Knowledge graph text replacement |
| Frontend build (`bun run build`) | Working | Vite build succeeds |
| `./scripts/install-hooks.sh` | Working | Installs pre-commit + UBS |

### Issues Found & Fixed

1. **README.md inconsistency (FIXED)**
   - Line 378 referenced `terraphim_tui` but package is `terraphim_agent`
   - Fixed in commit `420be37b`

### Known Limitations

1. **check-update command**: Returns 403 from GitHub API (rate limiting)
   - Not a code bug, network/auth issue

2. **search command**: Warns about missing `docs/src/kg` directory
   - Expected behavior - user must create knowledge graph files

3. **Thesaurus file warning**: "Failed to load thesaurus: NotFound"
   - Normal for fresh installs without persisted data

## Commits Made

- `420be37b` - docs(readme): fix terraphim_tui reference to terraphim_agent

## Next Steps

1. Consider adding sample knowledge graph files to repo
2. Document GitHub API rate limiting for check-update
3. Add integration tests for CLI commands
