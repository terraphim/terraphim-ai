# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Terraphim AI Agent Orchestration System is a sophisticated multi-agent framework that extends the existing Terraphim AI platform to support complex, coordinated workflows. This system will enable multiple AI agents to work together in structured patterns, leveraging Terraphim's existing graph embeddings, knowledge graphs, and role-based architecture to solve complex problems through intelligent task decomposition and parallel execution.

The system builds upon Terraphim's privacy-first, locally-operated infrastructure while introducing advanced agent coordination patterns including hierarchical planning-execution workflows and parallel agent orchestration with oversight mechanisms.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Terraphim AI user, I want to execute complex tasks through coordinated multi-agent workflows, so that I can solve sophisticated problems that require multiple specialized capabilities working together.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a complex task THEN the system SHALL decompose it into subtasks suitable for specialized agents
2. WHEN agents are coordinated in a workflow THEN the system SHALL maintain task dependencies and execution order
3. WHEN multiple agents execute in parallel THEN the system SHALL coordinate their outputs and resolve conflicts
4. IF an agent fails during execution THEN the system SHALL implement recovery mechanisms and alternative execution paths

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure different agent orchestration patterns, so that I can optimize workflows for different types of tasks and organizational needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring orchestration patterns THEN the system SHALL support hierarchical planning-lead-worker agent flows
2. WHEN configuring orchestration patterns THEN the system SHALL support parallel agent execution with overseer validation
3. WHEN patterns are configured THEN the system SHALL validate agent compatibility and resource requirements
4. IF configuration conflicts exist THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and resolution suggestions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a planning agent, I want to analyze complex tasks and create execution plans, so that specialized worker agents can execute subtasks efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving a complex task THEN the planning agent SHALL analyze task requirements and constraints
2. WHEN creating execution plans THEN the planning agent SHALL identify required agent types and capabilities
3. WHEN decomposing tasks THEN the planning agent SHALL create clear subtask specifications with success criteria
4. WHEN planning is complete THEN the planning agent SHALL generate a structured execution plan with dependencies

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a lead agent, I want to coordinate worker agents based on planning agent outputs, so that complex tasks are executed efficiently with proper oversight.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving an execution plan THEN the lead agent SHALL validate plan feasibility and resource availability
2. WHEN coordinating workers THEN the lead agent SHALL assign subtasks based on agent capabilities and current load
3. WHEN monitoring execution THEN the lead agent SHALL track progress and identify bottlenecks or failures
4. WHEN workers complete tasks THEN the lead agent SHALL integrate results and validate overall completion

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a worker agent, I want to execute specialized subtasks within my domain expertise, so that I can contribute effectively to larger workflows while maintaining focus on my specialized capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving a subtask assignment THEN the worker agent SHALL validate task compatibility with its capabilities
2. WHEN executing subtasks THEN the worker agent SHALL leverage Terraphim's knowledge graphs and embeddings for context
3. WHEN task execution is complete THEN the worker agent SHALL provide structured results with confidence metrics
4. IF subtask requirements exceed capabilities THEN the worker agent SHALL request assistance or escalate to lead agent

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an overseer agent, I want to validate outputs from parallel agent executions, so that I can ensure quality and consistency across distributed work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple agents complete parallel tasks THEN the overseer SHALL collect and analyze all outputs
2. WHEN validating outputs THEN the overseer SHALL check for consistency, completeness, and quality standards
3. WHEN conflicts are detected THEN the overseer SHALL implement resolution strategies or request agent re-execution
4. WHEN validation is complete THEN the overseer SHALL provide consolidated results with quality assessments

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the agent system, I want to leverage existing Terraphim infrastructure, so that agents can access knowledge graphs, embeddings, and role-based configurations seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents access knowledge graphs THEN the system SHALL use existing terraphim_rolegraph infrastructure
2. WHEN agents require embeddings THEN the system SHALL leverage existing graph embedding capabilities
3. WHEN agents need persistence THEN the system SHALL use existing terraphim_persistence backends
4. WHEN agents communicate THEN the system SHALL extend existing MCP server protocols for inter-agent messaging

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want to monitor and manage agent orchestration workflows, so that I can ensure system performance, debug issues, and optimize resource utilization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN workflows are executing THEN the system SHALL provide real-time monitoring of agent states and progress
2. WHEN performance issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information and bottleneck identification
3. WHEN workflows complete THEN the system SHALL generate execution reports with performance metrics
4. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL implement load balancing and priority management

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want agent orchestration to maintain Terraphim's privacy-first principles, so that sensitive data remains protected during multi-agent processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents process data THEN the system SHALL ensure all processing occurs locally without external data transmission
2. WHEN agents communicate THEN the system SHALL use secure inter-process communication mechanisms
3. WHEN workflows involve sensitive data THEN the system SHALL implement data isolation and access controls
4. WHEN audit trails are required THEN the system SHALL log agent actions while protecting sensitive content

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As an advanced user, I want to create custom agent types and orchestration patterns, so that I can extend the system for domain-specific workflows and specialized use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating custom agents THEN the system SHALL provide extensible agent definition interfaces
2. WHEN defining orchestration patterns THEN the system SHALL support custom workflow templates and execution logic
3. WHEN integrating custom components THEN the system SHALL validate compatibility with existing infrastructure
4. WHEN custom agents are deployed THEN the system SHALL support versioning and rollback capabilities
