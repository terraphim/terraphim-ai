# Ignore unmaintained proc-macro-error crate warning (RUSTSEC-2024-0370)
# This is a transitive dependency from Tauri's GTK stack (gtk3-macros, glib-macros)
# which we cannot directly control. This is just an unmaintained warning, not
# an actual security vulnerability. Tracked for resolution when upgrading to Tauri v2.
#
# RSA timing sidechannel (RUSTSEC-2023-0071) - transitive from sqlx-mysql via opendal
# No fixed version available yet. We don't use MySQL features directly.
# Severity: Medium (5.9). Low risk for our use case.
