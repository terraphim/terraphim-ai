     # VM Execution System Guide
     ## Overview
     The Terraphim Multi-Agent System integrates secure code execution capabilities using
     Firecracker MicroVMs. This guide covers the complete architecture for executing code from
     LLM agents in isolated VM environments with comprehensive safety, history tracking, and
     session management.

● Documentation update complete. Created comprehensive VM_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md with:

  - Architecture Components: All 6 major modules (models, code_extractor, client,
  session_adapter, hooks, fcctl_bridge)
  - Language Support: Python, JavaScript, Rust, Bash configurations with security restrictions
  - DirectSessionAdapter: HTTP API-based session management with examples
  - Hook System: Complete guide for all 5 built-in hooks plus custom hook implementation
  - Testing Strategy: Unit → Integration → E2E hierarchy with automation script usage
  - Security Considerations: Code validation, execution isolation, rollback mechanisms
  - Performance Optimization: VM pooling, session reuse, language-specific timeouts
  - Production Deployment: Infrastructure requirements, configuration best practices,
  monitoring
  - Complete Examples: End-to-end code samples for common use cases

  Updated @scratchpad.md to reflect completion of VM execution system documentation.


=== VM Execution Chat API Integration Debugging - 2025-10-06 21:50 ===

ISSUE: VM execution not triggering via /chat endpoint despite correct config

CURRENT FINDINGS:
1. Config correctly loaded: vm_execution.enabled=true in DevelopmentAgent role ✓
2. Source code modified with debug logging at api.rs:577 ✓
3. Binary built (21:47) and deployed (21:48) ✓  
4. Debug logs NOT appearing → code path not being reached ✗
5. LLM responds normally, only explains code instead of executing ✗

ROOT CAUSE HYPOTHESIS:
- The /chat endpoint may not be routing through the modified chat_completion function
- Logs show emoji output from LLM client building, but not from VM execution check
- Suggests code path diverges before reaching VM execution logic

DEBUGGING PLAN:
1. Verify /chat endpoint routing in terraphim_server/src/main.rs or routes
2. Add file-based debug logging to bypass systemd journal filtering
3. Test with direct VM execution API endpoint to isolate issue
4. Check if there's middleware intercepting before VM execution check

FILES MODIFIED:
- terraphim_server/src/api.rs:576-593 (VM execution check with logging)
- terraphim_server/default/ollama_llama_config.json (vm_execution config)

STATUS: Need to identify where /chat endpoint diverges from expected code path
