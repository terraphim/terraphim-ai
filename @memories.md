# Terraphim AI Project Memories

## Project Interaction History

[v1.0.1] Development: Updated @lessons-learned.md with comprehensive TUI implementation insights covering CLI architecture patterns for Rust TUI applications including hierarchical subcommand structure with clap derive API, event-driven architecture with tokio channels and crossterm for terminal input handling, async/sync boundary management using bounded channels to decouple UI rendering from network operations. Documented integration patterns with existing API endpoints through shared client architecture, type reuse strategies from server implementation, and consistent configuration management. Added detailed error handling for network timeouts and feature flags including graceful degradation patterns, runtime feature detection, and progressive timeout strategies. Included ASCII graph visualization techniques using Unicode box-drawing characters, data density optimization for terminal constraints, and interactive navigation capabilities. Covered command structure design with hierarchical organization, argument validation with sensible defaults, and support for both interactive and non-interactive modes. Implementation best practices include cross-platform terminal handling with feature detection, centralized state management patterns, and performance optimization with smart redraw strategies and virtual scrolling for large datasets.

[v1.0.2] Validation: Cross-referenced tracking files for consistency - verified version numbers match across @memories.md, @lessons-learned.md, and @scratchpad.md. All TUI implementation features marked as âœ… COMPLETE with validation status synchronized. QueryRs haystack integration shows 28 results for Iterator queries with proper Reddit and std documentation integration. OpenRouter summarization and chat features validated as implemented and functional across server, desktop, and configuration systems. Task dependencies in scratchpad updated to reflect completion status with proper cross-referencing to memory entries and lessons learned documentation.

[v1.0.3] LLM Abstraction: Introduced provider-agnostic LLM layer (`terraphim_service::llm`) with trait `LlmClient`, OpenRouter + Ollama adapters (feature-gated), and selection via role config `extra` keys. Rewired summarization path to use the abstraction while keeping OpenRouter compatibility. Compiles under default features and `openrouter`; tests build. Desktop Config Wizard exposes generic LLM (Ollama) provider fields.

[v1.0.3.1] E2E Ollama: Added mock and live tests for Ollama. Live test uses role with `llm_provider=ollama`, model `deepseek-coder:latest`, against local instance (`OLLAMA_BASE_URL` or default `http://127.0.0.1:11434`).

[v1.0.3.2] E2E Atomic/OpenRouter: Atomic server reachable at localhost:9883; basic tests pass, some ignored full-flow tests fail with JSON-AD URL error (environment-specific). OpenRouter live test executed with .env key but returned 401 (likely invalid key).

[v1.0.4] MCP Integration: Added `ServiceType::Mcp` and `McpHaystackIndexer` with SSE reachability and HTTP/SSE tool calls. Introduced features `mcp-sse` (default-off) and `mcp-rust-sdk` (optional) with `mcp-client`. Implemented transports: stdio (feature-gated), SSE (localhost with optional OAuth bearer), and HTTP fallback mapping server-everything `search/list` results to `terraphim_types::Document`. Added live test `crates/terraphim_middleware/tests/mcp_haystack_test.rs` (ignored) gated by `MCP_SERVER_URL`.

[v1.0.4.1] MCP SDK: Fixed content parsing using `mcp-spec` (`Content::as_text`, `EmbeddedResource::get_text`) and replaced ad-hoc `reqwest::Error` construction with `Error::Indexation` mapping. `mcp-rust-sdk` feature now compiles green.

[v1.0.5] Automata: Added `extract_paragraphs_from_automata` in `terraphim_automata::matcher` to return paragraph slices starting at matched terms. Includes paragraph end detection and unit test. Documented in `docs/src/automata-paragraph-extraction.md` and linked in SUMMARY.

[v1.0.6] RoleGraph: Added `is_all_terms_connected_by_path` to verify if matched terms in text can be connected by a single path in the graph. Included unit tests, a throughput benchmark, and docs at `docs/src/graph-connectivity.md`.

[v1.0.7] MCP Server Development: Implemented comprehensive MCP server (`terraphim_mcp_server`) exposing all `terraphim_automata` and `terraphim_rolegraph` functions as MCP tools. Added autocomplete functionality with both `autocomplete_terms` and `autocomplete_with_snippets` endpoints. Implemented text matching tools (`find_matches`, `replace_matches`), thesaurus management (`load_thesaurus`, `load_thesaurus_from_json`), and graph connectivity (`is_all_terms_connected_by_path`). Created Novel editor integration with autocomplete service leveraging built-in Novel autocomplete functionality. Replaced RocksDB with non-locking OpenDAL backends (memory, dashmap, sqlite, redb) for local development.

[v1.0.8] Summarization Queue System: Implemented production-ready async queue system for document summarization with priority management (Critical/High/Normal/Low), token bucket rate limiting, background worker with concurrent processing, and exponential backoff retry logic. Created RESTful async API endpoints for queue management. Addressed DateTime serialization issues by replacing `Instant` with `DateTime<Utc>`. Successfully integrated with existing LLM providers (OpenRouter, Ollama). System compiles successfully with comprehensive error handling and task status tracking.

[v1.0.8.1] AWS Credentials Error Fix (2025-08-22): Resolved recurring AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID environment variable error that was preventing local development. Root cause was twofold: 1) S3 profile in user settings file containing credentials that triggered shell variable expansion, and 2) persistence layer passing a FILE path (`crates/terraphim_settings/default/settings_local_dev.toml`) to `DeviceSettings::load_from_env_and_file()` which expects a DIRECTORY path. Fixed by correcting the path in `terraphim_persistence/src/lib.rs` to pass the directory path (`crates/terraphim_settings/default`) instead. This allows the settings system to work as designed, using local-only profiles (memory, dashmap, sqlite, redb) for development without AWS dependencies. Both server and Tauri desktop application now start successfully without AWS errors. Desktop app builds cleanly and Tauri dev process works normally.

[v1.0.9] Code Duplication Elimination - Phase 1 (2025-08-23): Completed comprehensive analysis and refactoring of duplicate code patterns across the codebase. **BM25 Scoring Implementation Consolidation**: Created centralized `crates/terraphim_service/src/score/common.rs` module housing shared `BM25Params` and `FieldWeights` structs, eliminating exact duplicates between `bm25.rs` and `bm25_additional.rs` (saved ~50 lines of duplicate code). **Query Struct Consolidation**: Replaced duplicate Query implementations in `mod.rs` and `search.rs` with single streamlined `TerraphimQuery` focused on document search functionality, removing IMDb-specific complexity. **Comprehensive Testing**: All BM25-related tests passing (51/56 total tests passing, 5 failing tests unrelated to refactoring). **Configuration & Testing Updates**: Fixed KG configuration in rank assignment test with `AutomataPath::local_example()`, resolved redb persistence configuration by adding missing `table` parameter to settings files. **Code Quality Improvements**: Reduced code duplication by ~500-800 lines, established single source of truth for critical components, standardized patterns across codebase with improved maintainability and consistency.

[v1.0.10] HTTP Client Consolidation - Phase 2 (2025-08-23): Successfully completed HTTP client consolidation, creating centralized `crates/terraphim_service/src/http_client.rs` module with 5 specialized factory functions (`create_default_client`, `create_client_with_timeout`, `create_api_client`, `create_scraping_client`, `create_custom_client`) to eliminate 23+ instances of raw `Client::new()` calls. **Implementation Strategy**: Updated all test files within terraphim_service and terraphim_server to use centralized clients, applied inline optimizations to external crates (terraphim_atomic_client, terraphim_automata, terraphim_tui) to respect dependency boundaries. **Dependency Management**: Made reqwest a standard dependency in terraphim_service (previously optional), updated feature flags accordingly. **Circular Dependency Resolution**: Identified and avoided circular dependencies between terraphim_middleware and terraphim_service by applying inline client builder patterns where centralized approach wasn't feasible. **Build Verification**: All builds successful with only warnings about unused code (expected during refactoring). **Code Quality**: Established consistent HTTP client configuration patterns, improved timeout handling and user agent specification, prepared foundation for future client feature standardization.

[v1.0.11] Logging Standardization - Phase 3 (2025-08-23): Completed logging initialization standardization across binaries, creating centralized `crates/terraphim_service/src/logging.rs` module with multiple configuration presets (`Server`, `Development`, `Test`, `IntegrationTest`, `Custom`) and smart environment detection. **Main Binary Updates**: Updated `terraphim_server/src/main.rs`, `desktop/src-tauri/src/main.rs` to use centralized logging with auto-detection of appropriate log levels based on debug assertions and environment variables. **MCP Server Enhancement**: Improved `terraphim_mcp_server` tracing setup with proper EnvFilter configuration and conditional timestamp formatting for SSE vs stdio modes. **Test File Standardization**: Updated server integration tests to use `LoggingConfig::IntegrationTest` and `LoggingConfig::Test`, standardized middleware test files with consistent `env_logger::builder()` patterns. **Dependency Management**: Added `env_logger` as standard dependency to `terraphim_service`, maintained optional `tracing` support for structured logging. **Architecture Respect**: Applied inline logging improvements to middleware crates to avoid circular dependencies while maintaining consistency. **Build Verification**: All builds successful, logging now standardized across 15+ binaries and test files with consistent log levels and formatting.

[v1.0.12] Error Handling Consolidation - Phase 4 (2025-08-23): Successfully completed comprehensive error handling standardization across the terraphim codebase, creating centralized `crates/terraphim_service/src/error.rs` module with common error patterns and utilities. **Core Error Infrastructure**: Implemented `TerraphimError` trait providing categorization (`Network`, `Configuration`, `Auth`, `Validation`, `Storage`, `Integration`, `System`), recoverability flags, and user-friendly messaging. Created `CommonError` enum with structured error variants and helper factory functions for consistent error construction. **ServiceError Enhancement**: Enhanced existing `ServiceError` to implement `TerraphimError` trait with proper categorization and recoverability assessment. Added `CommonError` variant for seamless integration with new error patterns. **Server API Integration**: Updated `terraphim_server/src/error.rs` to extract error metadata from service errors, enriching API responses with `category` and `recoverable` fields for better client-side error handling. Implemented error chain inspection to properly identify and extract terraphim error information. **Testing and Validation**: All existing tests continue passing (24/24 score tests), both service and server crates compile successfully with new error handling infrastructure. **Architecture Impact**: Established foundation for consistent error handling across all 13+ error types identified, enabling better debugging, monitoring, and user experience through categorized and structured error reporting.

### âœ… RESOLVED: AWS Credentials Error (2025-01-31)
- **Problem**: System required AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID when loading thesaurus due to S3 profile in default settings
- **Root Cause**: `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` in `terraphim_settings` included `settings_full.toml` with S3 profile requiring AWS credentials
- **Solution Implemented**:
  1. Changed `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` from `settings_full.toml` to `settings_local_dev.toml`
  2. Added fallback mechanism in S3 profile parsing to gracefully handle missing credentials
  3. Updated README with optional AWS configuration documentation
- **Result**: Local development now works without any AWS dependencies, cloud storage remains available when credentials are provided
