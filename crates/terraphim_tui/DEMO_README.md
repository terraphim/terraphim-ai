## Key Features to Highlight

### 1. **Markdown Command System**
- YAML frontmatter with metadata (risk level, execution mode, permissions)
- Rich content support with documentation
- Hot-reloading and directory scanning
- Knowledge graph validation

### 2. **Multi-Mode Execution**
- **Local Mode**: Safe commands on host machine
- **Firecracker Mode**: High-risk commands in isolated microVMs
- **Hybrid Mode**: Intelligent selection based on risk assessment

### 3. **Security Framework**
- Rate limiting with configurable windows
- Command blacklisting
- Time-based restrictions
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Role-based permissions

### 4. **Hook System**
- Pre/post command execution hooks
- Priority-based execution
- Built-in hooks for common operational needs
- Custom hook support

### 5. **Knowledge Graph Integration**
- Command validation against knowledge graphs
- Role-based concept access
- Synonym support
- Concept caching

```

## Commands Demonstrated

1. **hello-world.md**: Simple greeting command (Low risk, Local mode)
2. **search.md**: Knowledge graph search (Low risk, Local mode)
3. **deploy.md**: Application deployment (Medium risk, Hybrid mode)
4. **backup.md**: System backup (High risk, Firecracker mode)
5. **test.md**: Test suite execution (Medium risk, Hybrid mode)
6. **security-audit.md**: Security audit (High risk, Firecracker mode)

## Recording Tips

1. **Resolution**: Record at 1080p or higher for best quality
2. **Frame Rate**: 30 FPS is sufficient for terminal demos
3. **Audio**: Add narration explaining each feature
4. **Duration**: Total demo should be 15-20 minutes
5. **Editing**: Add zoom effects for important code sections

## Troubleshooting

### Session Issues
```bash
# Re-create demo session
tmux kill-session -t terraphim-demo
./demo_script.sh
```

### Recording Issues
```bash
# Check ffmpeg installation
ffmpeg -version

# Alternative: Use OBS Studio
# Alternative: Use system screen recorder
```
