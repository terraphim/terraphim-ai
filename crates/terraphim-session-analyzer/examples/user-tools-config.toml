# Example user configuration for custom tool patterns
#
# Save this file to: ~/.config/claude-log-analyzer/tools.toml
#
# This file allows you to define custom tool patterns that will be merged with
# the built-in patterns. User patterns with the same name as built-in patterns
# will override them.

# Example: Custom deployment script
[[tools]]
name = "custom-deploy"
patterns = ["./deploy.sh", "make deploy"]

[tools.metadata]
category = "CloudDeploy"
description = "Custom deployment script"
confidence = 0.9

# Example: Custom testing tool
[[tools]]
name = "my-test-runner"
patterns = ["./run-tests.sh", "npm run custom-test"]

[tools.metadata]
category = "Testing"
description = "Custom test runner script"
confidence = 0.85

# Example: Override built-in npm pattern with custom behavior
[[tools]]
name = "npm"
patterns = ["npm install", "npm run", "npm ci", "npm test"]

[tools.metadata]
category = "PackageManager"
description = "Custom npm configuration with limited patterns"
confidence = 0.95

# Example: Custom CI/CD tool
[[tools]]
name = "jenkins-cli"
patterns = ["jenkins-cli build", "jenkins-cli deploy"]

[tools.metadata]
category = "CloudDeploy"
description = "Jenkins CLI tool"
confidence = 0.8

# Notes:
# - The 'name' field must be unique within your configuration
# - User patterns with the same name as built-in patterns will override them
# - The 'patterns' array contains strings to match in Bash commands
# - Confidence should be between 0.0 and 1.0
# - Category can be one of: PackageManager, BuildTool, Testing, Linting, Git, CloudDeploy, Database
#   or a custom string for "Other" categories
