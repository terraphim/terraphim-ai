    Issue Report: Payroll System Data Inconsistency
    
    Problem Summary
    
    We have discovered a critical issue with our payroll system that affects employee 
    compensation calculations and HR system integration.
    
    Steps to Reproduce the Issue
    
    To recreate this issue, follow these reproduction steps carefully:
    1. Log into the HR system using administrator credentials
    2. Navigate to the payroll processing module 
    3. Select employees from the Q3 2024 cohort
    4. Run the salary calculation process for the selected group
    5. Observe the wage calculation discrepancies in the output report
    
    These repro steps should consistently demonstrate the problem. The issue occurs 
    every time we follow this procedure to reproduce the bug.
    
    Expected Behavior and System Requirements
    
    The intended behavior should be as follows:
    - The payroll system should calculate wages correctly for all employees
    - Data consistency should be maintained across all HR system components
    - System integration between payroll and HR databases should work seamlessly
    - Employee compensation should match the predefined salary structures
    - The expected result should show accurate wage calculations
    
    This represents the normal behavior we expect from a properly functioning system.
    The correct behavior would ensure all employee pay issues are resolved.
    
    Actual Behavior and Observed Problems
    
    What actually happens demonstrates significant system problems:
    - The observed behavior shows incorrect salary calculations for 30% of employees
    - Data mismatch occurs between the payroll system and HR database
    - System integration failures prevent proper data synchronization
    - Performance degradation causes slow response times during peak processing
    - The current behavior results in payroll discrepancies and employee complaints
    
    This faulty behavior represents a serious deviation from expected functionality.
    The system malfunction affects multiple HR workflows and user experience.
    
    Business Impact and Consequences Analysis
    
    The impact of this issue extends across multiple areas:
    
    User Impact:
    - Employees experience delayed or incorrect salary payments
    - HR staff spend excessive time on manual corrections
    - User experience suffers due to system reliability issues
    
    System Impact:
    - Database consistency problems affect data integrity
    - Integration failures disrupt automated HR processes
    - Performance issues slow down critical payroll operations
    
    Business Impact:
    - Operational impact includes increased manual processing costs
    - Employee satisfaction decreases due to payroll errors
    - Compliance risks arise from incorrect compensation calculations
    - The business consequences include potential legal liability
    
    This represents a critical issue requiring immediate attention from our QA process
    and quality assurance team to prevent further operational disruption.

    System Requirements and Expected Functionality
    
    The expected behaviour of our HR system should demonstrate proper functionality:
    - Correct behavior in salary calculations
    - Expected results that match employee contracts
    - Intended behavior for system integration processes
    - Normal behavior during peak processing periods
    
    The expected outcome should provide reliable payroll processing capabilities.
    This represents the intended result we expect from the system upgrade.

    Current System Issues and Observed Problems
    
    The actual behaviour we observe differs significantly from expectations:
    - Incorrect behavior in wage calculations affecting multiple employees
    - Observed behavior shows data synchronization failures
    - Current behavior includes system lag and performance degradation
    - Faulty behavior in the HR integration processes
    
    This system malfunction represents erroneous behavior that must be addressed.
    The bug behavior consistently occurs during payroll processing cycles.
