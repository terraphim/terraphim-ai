Therefore, a promising application combining PSS and equipment portrait is to establish a more refined portrait model to improve the accuracy and applicability of operation and maintenance (OM) schemes for industrial products. However, studies in the above field are facing many challenges. For example, the research on equipment portrait in the industrial field is still in its infancy. PSS and equipment portrait are studied separately, and the overall solution that integrates PSS and equipment portrait for complex products OM service is almost vacant. A personalised OM approach for complex products (POMA-CP) is proposed to address these challenges. First, a framework of POMA-CP is developed to show how the processes of refined OM can be implemented. Then, a solution of POMA-CP based on the framework is designed. A multi-level case library, dynamic equipment portrait model, and case-pushing mechanism are established and developed. Active pushing of the best similar cases and automatic generation of service schemes are realised. Finally, an application scenario for a high-speed electric multiple units (EMU) bogie is presented to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Higher accuracy and applicability for service schemes are achieved, resulting in the efficient reusing of OM knowledge, proactive implementation of refined maintenance, and reducing maintenance cost and resource consumption.\n\n-   [Previous](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S073658452200165X)\n-   [Next](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001715)\n\n##

Introduction\n\nProduct complexity has been described in the literature as having many dimensions (including the number of components, the number of modules, the diversity of relations between components, and the commonality of products in an assortment) [\\[1\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0001), [\\[2\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0002), [\\[3\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0003), while complex products are usually defined as a durable product with a lifespan of over 10–30 years [\\[4\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0004). In addition, complex products also have the characteristics of complex structure, long research and development (R&D) cycle, strict quality control and high maintenance service requirements \\[[5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0005),[6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0006)\\]. Therefore, complex products’ [operation and maintenance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/operation-and-maintenance \"Learn more about operation and maintenance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") (OM) service can provide huge potential for establishing a balance amongst users, [original equipment manufacturers](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/original-equipment-manufacturer \"Learn more about original equipment manufacturers from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") (OEMs), and natural environment \\[[7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0007),[8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0008)\\]. Complex products’ personalised OM service demands are emerging with the ever-increasing usage of customised products. As a result, many OEMs are making efforts to employ the product-service system (PSS) to provide high value-added service for their users to improve customer satisfaction and promote the implementation of cleaner production (CP) and circular economy (CE) strategies \\[[\\[9\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0009), [\\[10\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0010), [\\[11\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib69)\\].\n\nWith the advancement of smart technologies in the [Industry 4.0](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/industry-4-0 \"Learn more about Industry 4.0 from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") paradigm, the research on integrating PSS with OM services has attracted many scholars’ attention. As pointed out by Zheng et al. \\[[12](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0011),[13](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0012)\\], the combination of PSS and smart technologies can enable innovative applications of OM service for complex products. Exner et al. \\[[14](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0013)\\] analysed how OM services can be connected to the PSS to enhance machine availability while [reducing energy consumption](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/reducing-energy-consumption \"Learn more about reducing energy consumption from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and the cost of maintenance procedures. D. Mourtzis et al. \\[[15](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0014)\\] studied an unscheduled OM service of manufacturing equipment following the PSS. A maintenance planning system was proposed to facilitate [knowledge sharing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/knowledge-sharing \"Learn more about knowledge sharing from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") amongst OEMs, users and service providers within the PSS \\[[16](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0015)\\]. Recent research achievements, such as PSS-based maintenance grouping strategy \\[[17](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0016)\\], process-based OM service [knowledge management](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/knowledge-management \"Learn more about knowledge management from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") mechanism \\[[18](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0017)\\], sustainable service-orientated equipment maintenance \\[[19](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0018)\\], active [preventive maintenance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/preventive-maintenance \"Learn more about preventive maintenance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") with lifecycle big data \\[[6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0006),[8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0008),[20](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0019)\\], and lease-orientated opportunistic maintenance \\[[21](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0020)\\], etc., have provided significant references for industrial practitioners to develop and apply the PSS-based product OM pattern.\n\nHowever, the PSS-based OM services face new issues while the increase in product complexity and industrial automation. For instance, how to effectively integrate the scattered and multi-stage stakeholders and [lifecycle data](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/lifecycle-data \"Learn more about lifecycle data from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), rationally apply the historical OM service knowledge, and facilitate the OEMs to carry out personalised and refined OM services. Fortunately, equipment portrait, as an emerging technology derived from user portrait, can accurately describe personalised user needs \\[[22](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0021)\\] and construct fine-grained portrait models to analyse complex products’ operational status and fault symptoms \\[[23](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0022)\\]. Besides, equipment portrait has achieved initial success in software product development and maintenance \\[[24](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0023)\\], machine tools intelligent maintenance \\[[25](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0024)\\], and water supply infrastructures OM service \\[[26](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0025)\\]. Therefore, the equipment portrait shows great potential for addressing the above issues and realising personalised and refined product OM services.\n\nDespite the progress achieved by the researchers in the abovementioned work, new questions are arising from applying equipment portrait to personalised OM service of complex products in the [big data environment](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/big-data-environment \"Learn more about big data environment from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and Industry 4.0 paradigm:\n\nFirst, the core of equipment portrait is extracting the set of feature labels. However, the lifecycle data of complex products is usually characterized by high volume, high velocity and high variety \\[[27](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0026)\\]. As a result, it is difficult for industrial practitioners to effectively define different feature labels of products according to specific application scenarios when they are not clear on how to use the lifecycle data best \\[[28](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0027)\\]. That is, the prescriptive and structured processes for the establishment of equipment portrait models for complex products to make OM service decisions were seldom investigated. As pointed out by Liu et al. \\[[29](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0028)\\], a promising application of equipment portrait in the industrial field is the use of its model to conduct a targeted analysis of the performance of products and systems. Therefore, the authors highlight an important research question (RQ1): how should an equipment portrait-based framework for OM service delivery and execution process of industrial complex products be structured to exploit the values of portrait technology in product OM service activities?\n\nSecond, current research on product OM mostly combines either equipment portrait and maintenance service \\[[30](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0029)\\] or aligns PSS mode with maintenance policy planning \\[[17](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0016),[31](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0030)\\]. As pointed out by Grover et al. \\[[32](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0031)\\], the interaction of accessible product data and efficient [data analytics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/data-analytics \"Learn more about data analytics from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and appropriate business model can obtain more insights to improve maintenance services. However, virtually no literature provides knowledge of exploiting equipment portrait and PSS to bring out value from lifecycle data, and to carry out more precisely and prescriptive maintenance measures \\[[33](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0032),[34](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0033)\\]. This resulted in the industrial practitioners being unable to comprehensively and accurately assess the operational conditions of complex products, which makes it difficult to fulfil the current requirements of personalised and refined product OM services. This limitation stimulated another research question (RQ2): what methods can be applied to effectively integrate portrait technologies and PSS mode to extract knowledge from PSS delivery process data and to define feature labels, so as to support an equipment portrait-based decision for the OM service delivery and execution process?\n\nThis paper proposed a personalised OM approach for complex products (POMA-CP) based on equipment portrait within the PSS mode to answer both of the above questions. The proposed method can contribute to constructing a more accurate equipment portrait model based on the comprehensive, meticulous and personalised requirement information of complex products OM services. It is important to emphasise that, with the wide application of smart technologies in Industry 4.0, the large amount of data related to the product's operational status and the whole lifecycle captured in the PSS delivery processes are valuable assets for extracting the above information. Therefore, the combined PSS and equipment portrait application is not simply a study of innovative product management but provides a new paradigm for realising the preventive and refined as well as personalised OM service for complex products. The proposed approach has strong flexibility and adaptability toward complex products’ OM services in big data and Industry 4.0 environments. As a result, two such technologies incorporate numerous potentials for industrial practitioners to implement personalised and refined OM services.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organised as follows. [Section 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0002) reviews the relevant literature. [Section 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0006) and [Section 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0007) outline the overall framework and solution of POMA-CP based on equipment portrait, respectively. In [Section 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0020), an application scenario is presented to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. The conclusions, limitations, and future works are summarised in [Section 6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0025).\n\n## 2\\. Literature review\n\nThis section briefly reviews related studies in two aspects: (1) user portrait and equipment portrait, and (2) PSS-based product [OM](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/operation-and-maintenance \"Learn more about OM from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") service. The application of PSS mode creates the capability for [OEMs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/original-equipment-manufacturer \"Learn more about OEMs from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") to better control and manage their products, which in turn makes it possible to access and acquire the whole [lifecycle data](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/lifecycle-data \"Learn more about lifecycle data from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of PSS delivery processes \\[[6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0006),[35](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0034)\\]. These data can be analysed to provide sufficient feature labels set for constructing of more accurate and refined equipment portrait. Meanwhile, a promising application of equipment portrait is the use of its feature labels for specific scenarios to improve the efficiency and accuracy of OM services decision-making. Therefore, the PSS mode and portrait technology (user portrait or equipment portrait) are two major pillars to exploit the potential of lifecycle data and to carry out the personalised and refined product OM services. Knowledge gaps identified from the review are summarised at the end of [Section 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0002).\n\n### 2.1. User portrait and equipment portrait\n\nThe most cited definition of user portrait was introduced by Cooper \\[[36](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0035)\\], who believed that user portrait was a virtual representation of real users. Meanwhile, the user portrait can be divided into different types according to different behaviours and motivations. As a result, the common features of different users can be extracted and described by some labels. The user portrait is based on the real user. However, it is not specific to a certain person or user. Meanwhile, user portrait emphasises the research on a certain type of object with common characteristics and standards. Therefore, for user portraits, a virtual object usually corresponds to one or a class of physical entities.\n\nWith the advent of big data, the connotation of user portraits has changed. Gauch and Speretta believed that user portrait is mainly composed of weighted keywords and semantic web \\[[37](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0036)\\]. Teixeira et al. \\[[38](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0037)\\] pointed out that a user portrait is an information set of personal data extracted from massive user data and a model to describe a user's needs and preferences. The main challenges of user portrait applications in adaptive [recommender systems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/recommender-systems \"Learn more about recommender systems from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and intelligent e-commerce systems were investigated by Schiaffino and Amandi \\[[39](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0038)\\]. To improve the accuracy and performance of user portraits, an ontology-based portrait learning method was proposed \\[[40](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0039)\\]. The author found that the user portrait information can be enriched by integrating data mining and semantics. In the [big data environment](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/big-data-environment \"Learn more about big data environment from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), user portrait and its privacy challenges were discussed by Hasan et al. \\[[41](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0040)\\]. The authors investigated a concrete example of constructing a portrait model with [big data techniques](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/big-data-technique \"Learn more about big data techniques from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and the approach to preserving user privacy. A user behaviour portrait was developed based on the mobile phone [trajectory data](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/trajectory-data \"Learn more about trajectory data from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") to judge [airport](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/airfield \"Learn more about airport from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") congestion and provide suggestions for airport users \\[[42](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0041)\\]. A user portrait-based [transfer learning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/transfer-learning \"Learn more about transfer learning from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") mechanism was designed to conduct knowledge transfer amongst the cross-domain recommender systems \\[[43](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0042)\\]. The results showed that the accuracy of the proposed method substantially outperforms other methods. To solve the sparse data problem of e-commerce recommender systems, a diffusion-based algorithm was proposed to generate the user portrait and perform personalised and high-quality recommendations \\[[44](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0043)\\]. The experiments showed that the proposed algorithm outperforms the traditional collaborative [filtering algorithm](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/filtering-algorithm \"Learn more about filtering algorithm from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\").

The authors also analysed the influence of PSS design decisions on product reliability and OM activities. In order to increase productivity and perform accurate OM service, a PSS-based maintenance method supported by [augmented reality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/augmented-reality \"Learn more about augmented reality from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") was developed \\[[31](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0030)\\]. The authors found that the proposed method can be used to calculate the remaining operating time between failures and identify the available windows of the products to perform remote maintenance. After this, an assistance application of PSS-based [preventive maintenance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/preventive-maintenance \"Learn more about preventive maintenance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") for manufacturing equipment was introduced to improve the internal communication of Business to Business (B2B) and reduce time and cost during the maintenance service procedures \\[[15](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0014)\\]. An adaptive and PSS-based maintenance grouping strategy for complex multi-component systems was proposed to implement [predictive maintenance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/predictive-maintenance \"Learn more about predictive maintenance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") planning \\[[50](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0049)\\]. The author claimed that the proposed strategy could provide long-term dynamic planning for PSS providers. Within the [Internet of Things](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/internet-of-things \"Learn more about Internet of Things from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") (IoT) environment, how industrial practitioners can integrate real-time data and predictive analytics algorithms to manage maintenance policies dynamically and to realise PSS mode were explored by March and Scudder \\[[51](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0050)\\].

Based on the PSS mode, an opportunistic maintenance policy was developed to handle the challenges of multi-procedure capacity for serial-parallel leased systems and maximise the leasing profits \\[[21](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0020),[54](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0053)\\]. The authors suggest that the proposed policy can schedule maintenance intervals and can the maintenance decisions dynamically. A [joint](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/joints-structural-components \"Learn more about joint from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") optimisation model of maintenance and spare parts ordering policy was proposed for the use-orientated PSS to address the hardware failures and replacement spare parts problems \\[[55](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0054)\\].

An overview framework of the POMA-CP based on equipment portrait\n\nThis section outlines a novel approach for personalised product OM service. The objective of the proposed approach is to better integrate the PSS delivery processes with equipment portrait to achieve personalised and refined services for complex products.\n\nThe overall framework of the proposed approach is designed and depicted in [Fig. 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#fig0001). Under this framework, the equipment portrait model can be dynamically changed and updated through the shared data and knowledge amongst different [lifecycle stages](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/lifecycle-stage \"Learn more about lifecycle stages from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of PSS delivery processes. Consequently, personalised, refined and accurate OM service can be achieved. The proposed framework includes four components, namely (1) lifecycle data acquisition and value-added processing, (2) OM knowledge mining and service case management, (3) equipment portrait modelling and OM scheme generation, and (4) application services of personalised OM for complex products.\n\n![Fig 1](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0736584522001673-gr1.jpg)\n\n1.

[Download : Download full-size image](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0736584522001673-gr1.jpg \"Download full-size image\")\n\nFig. 1. The overall framework of the POMA-CP based on equipment portrait.\n\nComponent 1 is responsible for acquiring product lifecycle data by emerging perceptive technology and achieving data value-added by bill of material (BOM) mapping. First, the [IoT](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/internet-of-things \"Learn more about IoT from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") devices and [smart sensors](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/smart-sensors \"Learn more about smart sensors from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") are configured for complex products and their key components at the beginning of life to improve the self-sensing ability of products in the middle of life and the end of life \\[[61](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib70)\\]. For example, the real-time position and operational status data of products can be obtained through the configured GPS and smart sensors in the operation stage. Furthermore, the configured [radio frequency identification](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/radio-frequency-identification \"Learn more about radio frequency identification from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") (RFID) tags and Auto-ID devices can be used to quickly identify the maintenance objects’ information in the maintenance stage. Second, various BOMs can be established based on the data of different lifecycle stages, including engineering BOM, manufacturing BOM, process planning BOM, etc. Similarly, a service BOM of the OM stage can be built to organise the massive OM data and provide value-added data for the OM service decision-making. In this paper, a composite BOM structure (consisting of neutral BOM, instance BOM, maintenance task BOM, and collectively called xBOM) is designed to establish the service BOM. Finally, an xBOM mapping technology can be developed to ensure OM service information's consistency and traceability. Thereby, reliable and holistic data assets can be provided for the personalised and refined product OM services.\n\nGenerally, experience-based maintenance service decisions will lead to lower service efficiency and customer satisfaction. Therefore, it is necessary to mine the OM service knowledge from the historical OM data to provide powerful knowledge support for the personalised OM services by effective [knowledge management](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/knowledge-management \"Learn more about knowledge management from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and reuse (Component 2 in [Fig. 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#fig0001)). First, the information or knowledge of product fault category (e.g., fault position, fault cause, fault occurrence time) should be analysed and mined to establish the fault tree model of complex products. Second, according to the mined fault [category knowledge](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/knowledge-category \"Learn more about category knowledge from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and the case-based reasoning technology, the multi-level OM service case libraries can be constructed to organise the maintenance domain knowledge effectively. For example, an OM service case library can be divided into several sub-case libraries based on the different fault categories. Then, the fault feature keywords can be mapped to a specific fault category. These case libraries can provide valuable knowledge support for the following cases’ active pushing processes while reducing case search time and improving case matching efficiency. Third, by extracting fault symptom keywords and establishing a fault-feature [vector space model](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/vector-space-models \"Learn more about vector space model from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), the characteristics of OM service cases can be expressed to manage the OM service knowledge. As a result, knowledge reuse for personalised OM services can be realised.\n\nTo carry out the personalised and refined OM services of complex products, equipment portraits of different operating conditions and environments should be depicted accurately (Component 3 in [Fig. 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#fig0001)). Generally, the equipment portrait is made up of a label set. Therefore, the label library of OM services should be first constructed. Based on the features and requirements of complex products’ OM services, a three dimensions label library (including behaviour, attribute and fault feature labels) is designed in this paper. Second, considering the dynamics of fault features, an equipment portrait model consisting of multiple feature items (each feature item represents a fault category) and weights can be established using the space vector. Each feature is divided into attribute, behaviour, and fault symptom. As a result, two types of portrait models (i.e., attribute and behaviour feature model and fault symptom feature model) can be constructed. Besides, different model update mechanisms should be developed to update equipment portrait dynamically and periodically. Third, the similarity between source cases (in the established sub-case library) and target cases can be calculated to obtain the best similar cases, which can be further adjusted and optimised to match and generate the final OM scheme for the target products. Meanwhile, the new case should be updated in the original case library.\n\nApplication services of personalised OM are responsible for encapsulating multi-stage OM service business, including intelligent equipment monitoring, personalised OM service scheme, refined OM service management, and component defect improvement (Component 4 in [Fig. 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#fig0001)). For example, by integrating the historical lifecycle data and the real-time operational status data of complex products, portrait models of the key components can be established and updated to monitor their fault features intelligently. By combining the fault features of individual products and the recommended best similar case in the multi-level OM service library, the personalised OM service scheme for different products can be developed. The refined OM service management can realise the control and management of personnel assignment, [task scheduling](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/task-scheduling \"Learn more about task scheduling from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), spare parts supply, etc. According to the fault features and rules reflected by the portrait model in the OM processes, the weaknesses and defects information of current products can be identified. The information can support improving and updating the next generation of product design.\n\nThe logic and relation of the four components in [Fig. 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#fig0001) are described as follows. Component 1 can provide holistic and consistent data for Component 2 through emerging perceptive technology and xBOM mapping technology. As a result, effective knowledge mining, management and reuse in Component 2 can be achieved. Meanwhile, the real-time OM data of Component 1 provides OEMs with the opportunity to update the label library and equipment portrait dynamically and periodically. Therefore, the accuracy and effectiveness of the pushed OM service cases can be enhanced. In addition, the OM case library and knowledge reusing in Component 2 can provide knowledge support for constructing of label library and equipment portrait model in Component 3, which in turn improves the quality and reliability of generated OM scheme. Through Component 2 and Component 3, various application services related to personalised OM in Component 4 can be carried out.\n\n## 4\\. The solution of POMA-CP based on equipment portrait\n\nAccording to the proposed framework, the key technologies (mainly involving Component 2 and Component 3 in [Fig. 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#fig0001)) are introduced in this section, and as a solution of POMA-CP based on equipment portrait. These technologies include case-based reasoning OM knowledge management and reuse, equipment portrait modelling, and active OM service case-pushing.\n\n### 4.1. Case-based reasoning OM knowledge management and reuse\n\n#### 4.1.1. Multi-level OM service case library establishing\n\nDue to the powerful logical relation processing ability of failure mode & effect analysis (FMEA), it is widely used in fault diagnosis (especially for complex products with thousands of components) \\[[62](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0060)\\]. Generally, the FMEA for all complex product components is unnecessary. Therefore, the fault tree models of the critical components are established to conduct the FMEA in practice. A complete fault tree consists of top events, intermediate events and basic events. Due to the limited space, please refer to \\[[63](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0061),[64](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0062)\\] for more information about the main steps and specific methods for executing the FMEA.\n\nThe fault information and knowledge of complex products or critical components can be analysed and extracted based on the FMEA. To improve the efficiency of knowledge managing and reusing, a method for establishing the multi-level OM service case library based on the [FMEA and](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/failure-mode-and-effect-analysis \"Learn more about FMEA and from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") the extracted fault knowledge is developed in this paper (as seen in [Fig. 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#fig0002)).\n\n![Fig 2](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0736584522001673-gr2.jpg)\n\n1.

The structure for multi-level OM service case library of complex products.\n\nFirst, the complex products are divided into _Z_ critical component systems (represented by _[CCS](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/carbon-capture-and-storage \"Learn more about CCS from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\")<sub>z</sub>_) according to their structure and composition. Second, for the _z_th _CCS<sub>z</sub>_, it is divided into _n_ sub-case library (represented by _SCL<sub>z,i</sub>_, ) according to its _n_ fault category (represented by _FC<sub>z,i</sub>_). Third, in the _i_th _SCL<sub>z,i</sub>_, a number of fault symptoms are included. Assume that a total of _m<sub>i</sub>_ fault symptom keywords (represented by _FSK<sub>z,i,j</sub>_, ) are extracted from the fault symptom. Each OM service case (represented by _CASE<sub>z,i,k</sub>_, ) in the _SCL<sub>z,i</sub>_ corresponds to a fault feature space vector that is composed of multiple _FSK_, and contains the essential attribute of product fault and corresponding maintenance scheme (represented by _MS<sub>z,i,k</sub>_). The method of _FSK_ extracting and _CASE_ representation will be described in the following section in detail.\n\n#### 4.1.2. Case-based reasoning OM knowledge reusing\n\nIn this paper, the _CASE_ is regarded as a basic unit of OM knowledge, and each _CASE_ includes some fault information such as fault locations, categories, symptoms and maintenance measures. Therefore, the accuracy of the _CASE_ information expression will greatly affect the efficiency of OM knowledge reuse. Here, the _CASE_ expression refers to a structured description of the information in the historical _CASE_, which is a method of organising the case information according to a specific format. The _CASE_ for complex products can be defined as a four-tuple, as shown below:(1)where, describes the basic information of the _CASE_ for the complex product _CCS_, including case number, fault time, fault location, and fault [symptom description](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/symptom-description \"Learn more about symptom description from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") text, etc. (_S, E_) is the feature set of the _CASE_, where _S_ is the fault symptom feature vector of _CASE_ and represented as , including the _FSK_ () of _CASE_ and its corresponding weight . _E_ is the attribute label information and behaviour label information of _CASE_, including fault location, operating environment, operating parameters, and represented as . Finally, _Q_ is the fault conclusion, including the information on OM service solutions and evaluation results.\n\nThe method for establishing attribute labels and behaviour labels is illustrated in [Section 4.2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0013). The following content of this section will introduce the extraction method of _FSK_ and the [construction processes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/construction-process \"Learn more about construction processes from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of the fault symptom feature vector of _CASE_.\n\n##### 4.1.2.1. Fault symptom keywords extracting\n\nTo quantitatively express the fault symptom feature vector of the _CASE_ text, the text segmentation operation should be performed on the fault record text to obtain the _FSK_. As the best word segmentation module of Python, the _Jieba_ algorithm is widely used in Chinese text segmentation due to its high accuracy and supporting customised dictionaries and multiple modes \\[[65](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0063)\\].\n\nHowever, for a specific complex industrial product, the existing text segmentation tool is difficult to deal with the professional terms effectively. Therefore, it is necessary to supplement and customise the professional dictionary of _CASE_ before performing the text segmentation operation and then carry out the following operations:\n\n-   1)\n    \n    Based on the constructed professional dictionary of _CASE_, the _Jieba_ tokeniser is used to carry out the text segmentation operation, and the forward maximum [matching algorithm](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/matching-algorithm \"Learn more about matching algorithm from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") is adopted to capture the string as long as possible.\n    \n-   2)\n    \n    Based on the text segmentation operation of _CASE_, the fault feature words set will be obtained by setting a stop word table and eliminating the function words and prepositions in fault record sentences.\n    \n-   3)\n    \n    Extract the feature words used to express the OM service domain knowledge of complex products to construct the _FSK_ lexicon. Then, the Chi-square test is used to judge the correlation between fault categories and words in the _FSK_ lexicon. Finally, the words that have a high correlation with product OM service are extracted as the _FSK_. The calculation process of correlation is described in detail as follows:\n    \n\nFor a specific _CCS<sub>z</sub>_, supposing it contains _n FC<sub>z,i</sub>_, and the _CCS<sub>z</sub>_ has _N CASE_. Specifically, for a fault feature word _T_, regarding whether it contains _T_ and whether it belongs to _FC<sub>z,i</sub>_ as the judging conditions, and four values A, B, C and D are obtained (as shown in [Table 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0002)).\n\nTable 2. The relationships between categories and attributes.\n\n| Feature selection | Belong to _FC<sub>z,i</sub>_ | Not belong to _FC<sub>z,i</sub>_ | Event name |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Contain _T_ | A | B | _A_ + _B_ |\n| Not contain _T_ | C | D | C + D |\n| Total | A + C | _B_ + D | _A_ + B + C + D |\n\nCalculating the theoretical value _E<sub>A</sub>_ and difference value _D<sub>A</sub>_ of A by the following formula:(2)(3)(4)\n\nThe method for calculating the theoretical value and difference value for B, C and D is similar to A. The specific methods are not repeated here. Then, the chi-square value between fault feature word _T_ and _FC<sub>z,i</sub>_ is calculated by using the original hypothesis that _T_ is not correlated with _FC<sub>z,i</sub>_:(5)\n\nAt the same time, the chi-square value of the fault feature word _T_ relative to the whole _CASE_ library of the _CCS<sub>z</sub>_ is calculated:(6)where, represents the probability that the case in the _CASE_ library of the _CCS<sub>z</sub>_ belongs to the _FC<sub>z,i</sub>_. The greater the value , the larger the error for the original hypothesis. That is, the fault feature word _T_ has a strong correlation with the _FC<sub>z,i</sub>_. Subsequently, calculating the chi-square values of all fault feature words according to the abovementioned method and arranging them from large to small. Meanwhile, a certain number of fault feature words are screened according to a preset threshold value. As a result, the _FSK_ lexicon can be established.\n\n##### 4.1.2.2. Fault symptom feature vector constructing of the _case_\n\nThe _i_th _SCL<sub>z,i</sub>_ corresponds to the _i_th _FC<sub>z,i</sub>_ of the _z_th _CCS<sub>z</sub>_ (as seen in [Fig. 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#fig0002)), and the _k_th _CASE<sub>z,i,k</sub>_ is analysed. Therefore, _R_ fault symptom keywords (i.e., ) contained in the case text are first extracted, and then the [vector space model](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/vector-space-models \"Learn more about vector space model from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of the fault symptom feature of the _CASE_ is established. Here, the case text is regarded as a vector space composed of a group of [orthogonal vectors](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/orthogonal-vector \"Learn more about orthogonal vectors from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). The fault symptom feature vector of the _CASE_ is expressed as , () is the _FSK_, is the weight of each _FSK_.\n\nThe weight can be calculated by the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) algorithm. The TF-IDF is a feature weight algorithm based on term frequency, which is used to evaluate the importance of a feature word to a particular text in a file set \\[[66](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0064),[67](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0065)\\]. TF is the word frequency of feature words in a particular text, and IDF measures the importance of a feature word. Therefore, the weight of is expressed as a function of and . The is calculated by:(7)where, refers to the times of occurred in a certain _CASE_, and is the total number of occurred in the _CASE_.\n\nMeanwhile, the is calculated by:(8)where, is the total number of all _CASE_ in the _FC<sub>z,i</sub>_, is the number of _CASE_ that contain in the _FC<sub>z,i</sub>_.\n\nThe weight of is calculated by:(9)\n\nThe greater the value (i.e., TF-IDF value) of , the more important it is to the _CASE_. Based on the obtained weight of each , the feature selection weight of (namely the weight threshold of TF-IDF) is defined and determined by the following equation:(10)\n\nIf , the of the _CASE_ is retained; if , the of the _CASE_ is excluded. Finally, the retained is used to construct the fault symptom feature vector of the _CASE_.\n\nFurthermore, the weight can be further normalised by the following formula:(11)\n\n### 4.2. Equipment portrait modelling and OM service case active pushing\n\n#### 4.2.1. Label library constructing and equipment portrait modelling\n\nA proper label library is significant to establishing an equipment portrait model. Generally, a label is a tuple containing product attributes and values. It can be described as _Label_\\=<_Name: W_\\>, where _name_ indicates the label name, and _W_ is the weight. The type and value of weight are determined by label attributes, including numerical type, interval [data type](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/data-type \"Learn more about data type from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), text type, etc.).\n\n##### 4.2.1.1. Label library designing for complex products\n\nIn view of the characteristics and OM service requirements of complex industrial products, a three dimensions label library (including attribute label, behaviour label and fault symptom label) is designed in this paper. They are briefly introduced as follows:\n\nThe attribute label represents the inherent static attributes of complex products, such as equipment type, manufacturer, rated power, and other information. This information will not change dynamically over time and can be obtained directly from the product database.\n\nThe behaviour label consists of the operational status information of complex products, which may change dynamically with time (e.g., operational time, average failure rate, maintenance times, operational environment). Such labels can be obtained by statistical or logical calculation.\n\nThe fault symptom label is similar to the _FSK_ in [Section 4.1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0008). Such labels may change dynamically over time and can be obtained by analysing and mining complex products’ operational performance record text. For example, the [operational load](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/operational-load \"Learn more about operational load from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") is too high, abnormal wear in the bearing shell, bearing temperature is too high, etc.\n\n##### 4.2.1.2. Portrait modelling for complex products\n\nBased on the label library, an equipment portrait model of complex products can be developed. For the _CCS_ of complex products, the equipment portrait model _M<sub>u</sub>_ can be defined as follows:(12)where (_F<sub>i</sub>, E<sub>i</sub>_) represents the fault category feature vector that corresponds to _FC<sub>i</sub>_ in the _CCS_, each (_F<sub>i</sub>, E<sub>i</sub>_) is associated with a weight _ω<sub>i</sub>_. The weight _ω<sub>i</sub>_ refers to the proportion of the occurred times of _F<sub>i</sub>_ amongst all fault categories in a fixed time window. In particular, only the feature vectors whose weights are greater than the threshold _ω<sub>threshold</sub>_ can appear in the equipment portrait model _M<sub>u</sub>_.\n\nThe fault category feature vector (_F<sub>i</sub>, E<sub>i</sub>_) mainly contains:\n\n-   (1)\n    \n    **Fault symptom feature model _F<sub>i</sub>_**. Considering the name of labels in the fault symptom feature model are dynamical changing, it can be described as:(13)\n    \n\nwhere () is the th fault symptom label; is the weight, which indicates the importance of the fault feature; is the time when the label is added to _F<sub>i</sub>_; is the time when the label is last updated in _F<sub>i</sub>_. The weight consists of the local weight and global weight of the label, which is calculated by the following formula:(14)\n\n-   1)\n    \n    Local weight of the label\n    \n\nThe value of the local weight is determined by the occurred times of fault symptom label in the . To avoid , the local label is redefined as:(15)where indicates the occurred times of label in in the historical OM records.\n\n-   1)\n    \n    Global weight of the label\n    \n\nThe local weight cannot be used to measure the accuracy of different labels in identifying various fault categories. Therefore, the concept of [conditional entropy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/conditional-entropy \"Learn more about conditional entropy from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") is introduced to define the global weight of the label \\[[68](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0066)\\], which is represented by . First, the fault categories set is seen as the information sources which conform to some probability distribution, and the _FC_ and the label are regarded as two [random variables](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/random-variable-xi \"Learn more about random variables from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). Second, the importance of a label to a certain _FC_ is determined by the gain between the information entropy of the fault categories set and the conditional entropy of the label \\[[69](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0067)\\]. Finally, the conditional entropy of the _FC,_ which corresponds to the label, can be calculated by the following formula:(16)where indicates the probability of when the label appears, when the label is determined, . As a result, the above equation can be expressed as:(17)where indicates the number of _FC_ in the fault categories set; indicates the times of in ; indicates the times of in the whole fault categories set.\n\n-   (1)\n    \n    **Attribute and behaviour feature model _E<sub>i</sub>_**. Considering the name of labels for attribute and behaviour feature model is fixed, the occurred times of label do not need to be considered when establishing the . Therefore, the attribute and behaviour feature model can be described as:(18)\n    \n\nwhere () represents the attribute label or behaviour label. It contains detailed information related to the _FC_ and other essential information (such as manufacturer, component number, operational status, [service duration](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/service-duration \"Learn more about service duration from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), operational load, etc.); is the label content.\n\nWhen a label of an abnormal event appears in the OM service abnormal event log text set, it is important to map it to the corresponding FC accurately, and then the personalised and refined OM services can be realised. To achieve this objective, the [conditional probability](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/conditional-probability \"Learn more about conditional probability from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of the abnormal event label belonging to each _FC_ should be first calculated. Then the _FC_ of the abnormal event label is divided into the categories with the highest conditional probability value. The main steps for calculating the conditional probability of the abnormal event label are as follows:\n\n-   1)\n    \n    Given an abnormal event log text as a sample set, where the _FC_ is known. Calculating the conditional probability of each abnormal event label in each _FC_:(19)\n    \n-   2)\n    \n    Assuming that the abnormal event labels of the sample set are independent of each other, the probability of an abnormal event log text with a label belonging to the FCi is calculated by the following formula:(20)P(FCi|attr)\\=P(attr|FCi)P(FCi)P(attr)\n    \n-   3)\n    \n    For all fault categories, the P(attr) can be regarded as a constant, so P(attr) can be removed and P(attr|FCi)P(FCi) can be calculated separately, namely:(21)P(attr|FCi)P(FCi)\\=P(attr1|FCi),P(attr2|FCi),...,P(attrm|FCi)P(FCi)\\=P(FCi)∏j\\=1mP(attrj|FCi)\n    \n-   4)\n    \n    Therefore, the _FC_ of the abnormal event log text is determined as:(22)FC\\=argmaxP(FCi)∏j\\=1mP(attrj|FCi)\n    \n\nThe above method regards the weight of all labels as equal. However, various labels play different roles in different [text classification](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/text-classification \"Learn more about text classification from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") application scenarios. To improve the text classification performance, the TF-IDF algorithm in [Section 4.1.2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0010) is used to calculate the weight of abnormal event text labels for the _CASE_ and carry out the mapping between abnormal event labels and fault categories.\n\nAssume that the abnormal event log text of a _CASE_ has a label attr\\={attr1,attr2,...,attrm}, the term frequency of attrj is calculated by TF(attrj)\\=nj∑i\\=1mni, nj refers to the occurred times of attrj in the abnormal event log text, and ∑i\\=1mni is the total number of the attrj occurred in the _CASE_. Meanwhile, the [inverse document frequency](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/inverse-document-frequency \"Learn more about inverse document frequency from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of attrj in the abnormal event relative to the FCi is calculated by IDF(attrj,FCi)\\=logNiNi,j+1, Ni is the number of cases in the _CASE_ library of the FCi, and Ni,j is the number of cases in the _CASE_ library where FCi contains label attrj.\n\nFor the abnormal event log text that contains the label attr\\={attr1,attr2,...,attrm}, the weight ωi,j of label attrj relative to the FCi is calculated by:(23)ωi,j\\=TF(attrj)\\*IDF(attrj,FCi)\n\nFinally, the _FC_ of the abnormal event log text is identified as:(24)FC\\=argmaxP(FCi)∏j\\=1mP(attrj|FCi)ωi,j\n\n#### 4.2.2. OM service case active pushing and scheme decision-making\n\nDue to the dynamic changing of behaviour label and fault symptom label in the equipment portrait model, real-time monitoring and tracing of the CCS that frequently occurred faults can be achieved. As a result, the reuse of historical OM knowledge can be realised. Based on the dynamic monitoring of _CCS_ and efficient reusing of OM knowledge, an active pushing mechanism for the _CASE_ is proposed. The processes of active pushing of the _CASE_ for complex products are shown in [Fig. 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#fig0003). For each feature item of the equipment portrait model, the similarity between the sub-case library and the target case should be calculated to obtain the best similar cases. Then, the best similar cases are adjusted according to the target case's requirements and the OM service scheme is generated applicable to the target product. The local similarity and global similarity of _CASE_ are involved.\n\n![Fig 3](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0736584522001673-gr3.jpg)\n\n1.

The active pushing processes of complex products’ OM service cases.\n\n##### 4.2.2.1. The local similarity calculation of OM service case\n\nAssuming that the fault category feature vector of _FC<sub>i</sub>_ in equipment portrait model _M<sub>u</sub>_ is (_F<sub>i</sub>, E<sub>i</sub>_). Let CASEFCi\\={CASEFCi,1,CASEFCi,2,....} represents the _SCL_ of _FC<sub>i</sub>_, and CASEFCi,k represents the kth _CASE_ of the _SCL_. Usually, the types of label values for the equipment portrait model mainly include symbols, numerical values, interval numbers and texts. Therefore, to achieve the active pushing of _CASE_ and the refined OM services, it is necessary to calculate the local similarity for different label values. Usually, the label value types for model _E<sub>i</sub>_ are mainly symbols, numerical values and interval numbers, while the label value types for model _F<sub>i</sub>_ are mainly texts.\n\nFor a label attrj, let LS(Eij,CASEFCi,kj) represent the local similarity between model Ei and CASEFCi,k, WEj and WFCj represents the values of Ei and CASEFCi,k, respectively. Meanwhile, let LS(Fij,CASEFCi,kj)represent the local similarity between model Fi and CASEFCi,k. The calculation methods of local similarity for different label value types are introduced as follows.\n\n-   (1)\n    \n    Symbol\n    \n\nSymbol labels usually have a fixed value set, enumerating all possible values for these labels. And each value is represented by an explicit symbol. For example, the value of the label ‘_CNC machine_’ can be _JV_<sub>1</sub>, _JV_<sub>2</sub>, _JV_<sub>3</sub>, _JV_<sub>5</sub>, etc. Then, the local similarity of the symbol label is calculated by:(25)LS(Eij,CASEFCi,kj)\\={1WEj\\=WFCj0WEj≠WFCj\n\n-   (1)\n    \n    Numerical value\n    \n\nLet max(CASEFCij) and min(CASEFCij) represent the maximum value and minimum value of label attrj in the _SCL_ that correspond to the FCi, respectively. Therefore, the local similarity of the numerical value label is calculated by:(26)LS(Eij,CASEFCi,kj)\\=1−|WEj−WFCj|max(CASEFCij)−min(CASEFCij)\n\n-   (1)\n    \n    Interval number\n    \n\nThe upper and lower bounds of the interval are represented by Lj and Hj respectively, and label attrj∈\\[Lj,Hj\\]. Therefore, the local similarity of the interval number label is calculated by:(27)LS(Eij,CASEFCi,kj)\\=1−|WEj−LjHj−Lj−WFCj−LjHj−Lj|\n\n-   (1)\n    \n    Text\n    \n\nText similarity is mainly reflected in the fault symptom feature model Fi. That is, if the label is an evaluation label, the label name is a text type, and the value is the weight of each label. Given Fi and a case S\\={(attr1:η1),...,(attrm:ηm)} in the CASEFCi,k. Only the common labels of Fi and S are considered. Thereby, Fi\\={(attr1F:η1F),...,(attrnumFF:ηnumFF)}, S\\={(attr1FC:η1FC),...,(attrnumFFC:ηnumFFC)}. Let Fij is the jth common label attrjF in Fi, and its similarity is LS(Fij,CASEFCi,kj)\\=ηjF·ηjFC. As a result, the local similarity of text label is calculated by:(28)LS(Fi,CASEFCi,k)\\=∑j\\=1numFηjF·ηjFC\n\n##### 4.2.2.2. The global similarity calculation of OM service case\n\nLocal similarity can only be used to measure the relationship between Fi (or Ei) of equipment portrait model _M<sub>u</sub>_ and the _CASE_. Therefore, the local similarity calculation for different label values has some limitations. For instance, it is difficult to achieve accurate pushing of the _CASE_ and thus difficult to carry out refined OM service. To overcome these limitations, it is necessary to calculate further the global similarity between the (_F<sub>i</sub>, E<sub>i</sub>_) of equipment portrait model _M<sub>u</sub>_ and _CASE_.\n\nConsidering the dynamic changing of the label in _F<sub>i</sub>_ and the missing attribute of the label in _E<sub>i</sub>_, the structure similarity should be involved while calculating the global similarity between (_F<sub>i</sub>, E<sub>i</sub>_) and CASEFCi,k. The global similarity GS(Fi,CASEFCi,k) of the fault symptom feature model _F<sub>i</sub>_ and CASEFCi,k is obtained by summing up the local similarity of the common fault symptom labels of _F<sub>i</sub>_ and CASEFCi,k, and then multiplying the structural similarity:(29)GS(Fi,CASEFCi,k)\\=JS(Fi,CASEFCi,k)·LS(Fi,CASEFCi,k)\\=NFi∩CASEFCi,kNFi∪CASEFCi,k·∑j\\=1numFηjF·ηjFCwhere, JS(Fi,CASEFCi,k) is the structural similarity of _F<sub>i</sub>_ and CASEFCi,k; NFi∩CASEFCi,k is the number of attributes for the [intersection set](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/intersection-set \"Learn more about intersection set from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of _F<sub>i</sub>_ and CASEFCi,k; NFi∪CASEFCi,k is the number of attributes for the union set of _F<sub>i</sub>_ and CASEFCi,k; numF is the number of common fault symptom labels.\n\nIn the same way, the global similarity GS(Ei,CASEFCi,k) between the attribute and behaviour feature model _E<sub>i</sub>_ and the CASEFCi,k is obtained by summing up the local similarity of the common attribute and behaviour labels of _E<sub>i</sub>_ and CASEFCi,k, and then multiplying the structural similarity:(30)GS(Ei,CASEFCi,k)\\=JS(Ei,CASEFCi,k)·∑j\\=1numELS(Eij,CASEFCi,kj)ρj∑j\\=1numEρj\\=NEi∩CASEFCi,kNEi∪CASEFCi,k·∑j\\=1numELS(Eij,CASEFCi,kj)ρj∑j\\=1numEρjwhere, JS(Ei,CASEFCi,k) is the structural similarity of _E<sub>i</sub>_ and CASEFCi,k; NEi∩CASEFCi,k is the number of attributes for the intersection set of _E<sub>i</sub>_ and CASEFCi,k; NEi∪CASEFCi,k is the number of attributes for the union set of _E<sub>i</sub>_ and CASEFCi,k; numE is the number of common attribute and behaviour labels; ρj(j\\=1,2,..,num) is the weight of common label, which is determined by expert experience.\n\nFinally, the global similarity between the (_F<sub>i</sub>, E<sub>i</sub>_) and the CASEFCi,k is calculated by the following formula:(31)GS((Fi,Ei),CASEFCi,k)\\=GS(Fi,CASEFCi,k)·ρF+GS(Ei,CASEFCi,k)·ρEρF+ρEwhere, ρF is the weight of _F<sub>i</sub>_, and ρE is the weight of _E<sub>i</sub>_.\n\nAfter calculating the global similarity between each (_F<sub>i</sub>, E<sub>i</sub>_) of equipment portrait model _M<sub>u</sub>_ and _CASE_ of the _SCL_, the best similar cases that correspond to these fault category feature vectors can be obtained by ranking the similarity from large to small. The higher the similarity value ranked, the more valuable the _CASE_ is for future OM service solutions. Then, a set composed of these best similar cases is formed. These best similar cases will further correspond to a set that consists of some OM service solutions. According to the real-time operational status of complex products, the solutions can be dynamically adjusted (such as deleting, adding, replacing, modifying, etc.). As a result, the final OM service scheme can be generated and actively pushed to the OM service scene. Therefore, auxiliary decision support can be provided for complex products’ personalised and refined OM services. In addition, for the _CASE_ with low similarity, it does not mean that it has no value for OM service decision-making. For example, experienced maintenance personnel can help judge and verify the usefulness of the _CASE_. As a result, the modified _CASE_ according to the abovementioned operations can be updated and added to the _SCL_ to enrich the case library, and to provide more similar cases for OM service decision-making.\n\n## 5\\. A study of the application scenario\n\nThe proposed approach is tested by an application scenario of an industrial partner company. The main objectives of the application scenario study are to test how equipment portrait can be used in the OM service of complex products and what improvements are made by the combined application of equipment portrait and PSS in personalised OM service.\n\nIn this section, an overview of the application scenario is provided. Then, the established methods of the application scenario's multi-level OM service case library are introduced. Third, the active pushing processes of OM service cases for bogie wheelsets of high-speed electric multiple units (EMUs) are elaborated. Finally, the advantages of the proposed POMA-CP based on equipment portrait within the PSS mode are analysed and discussed.\n\n### 5.1. Overview of the application scenario\n\nThe partner company is a rail transit equipment manufacturer in China which focuses on the R&D, manufacturing, service and maintenance support of high-end railway equipment. The company has manufactured over 10,000 trains in varieties. These trains include high-speed EMUs, intercity EMUs, and urban rail vehicles used by more than 18 railway companies across China. Because the company's trains are mainly used in the passenger transport area, it is of [utmost importance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/utmost-importance \"Learn more about utmost importance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") for the company to prevent faults and ensure safety and reliability. In recent years, the company has developed and manufactured a series of new high-speed EMUs with a top speed of 350 km/h and 400 km/h.\n\nBogie is one of the important components to realise the running task of a high-speed EMU, which has a lifespan of over 20–30 years. It is responsible for guidance, [vibration reduction](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/vibration-reduction \"Learn more about vibration reduction from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), traction, braking and other tasks of the EMUs. The maintenance of the bogie and its key components in a timely and accurate manner directly determines the operational performance and safety of the EMU \\[[70](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0068)\\]. Therefore, it has high quality and maintenance service requirements. In addition, the bogie also has the characteristics of a complex structure. For example, the bogie generally consists of a wheelset, axle box, [bogie frame](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/bogie-frame \"Learn more about bogie frame from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), mechanical drive unit, foundation brake rigging, primary suspension, secondary suspension, etc. Each component is made up of thousands of parts. Meanwhile, all the abovementioned tasks of the EMU need to be realised by the complex movement relations between different components of the bogie. Therefore, the EMU bogie is a typical complex product. [Fig. 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#fig0004) is a schematic diagram of the H38L (a virtual name used in this paper) high-speed EMU bogie manufactured by the partner company.\n\n![Fig 4](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0736584522001673-gr4.jpg)\n\n1.

The schematic diagram of the H38L high-speed EMU bogie.\n\nIn the past, since local railway companies operated the EMUs in different geographical areas, the operational status data of EMU and their critical components in diverse conditions could not be acquired accurately and completely. As a result, the efficiency of OM service schemes for EMU based on incomplete and inaccurate operational status data was lower, which has directly affected the safety and service life of EMU. Meanwhile, the knowledge that affects fault analysis and service decision-making is difficult to reuse due to the unreasonable organisation and management of historical OM knowledge. This has made active pushing of OM service cases extremely difficult to realise.\n\nTherefore, it is important to determine how to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of OM service cases pushing and schemes decision-making for EMU to improve safety and reliability, which was the main challenge the partner company faced for a long period. Recently, with the rapid advancement of portrait technology and the wide application of PSS mode, the company sought a new way to achieve the potential of applying the lifecycle data and historical OM knowledge of EMUs for fault analysis and OM scheme decision-making and to transform its manufacturing mode from the product-driven pattern to the system-integration and the service-driven one. Therefore, they tested the novel approach according to [Section 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0006). The proposed approach was tested and followed the combination of quantitative and qualitative methods based on case analysis and semi-structured interviews.\n\n### 5.2. Establishing of bogie multi-level OM service case library\n\nThe failure reporting analysis and corrective action system (FRACAS) is the main tool developed by the partner company and its service providers to manage the OM data of EMUs within the service-driven manufacturing mode. In the FRACAS, the fault record data of the operation process and maintenance site for the geographically scattered EMU are included, which is analysed in this paper to excavate the fault information of bogie. The fault information of the EMU bogie is automatically triggered by the activation of an alarm function that setting in the FRACAS.\n\nThe FRACAS can record multiple fields related to EMU fault information (e.g., date of fault, EMU number, fault description, fault cause, fault effect, troubleshooting measure, responsible department, etc.). Based on this information, the working principle and operating environment of the EMU are further aligned to construct the fault system of the EMU bogie (as shown in [Table 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0003)).\n\nTable 3. The fault system of EMU bogie.\n\n| **Critical component system fault** | **Sub-system fault** | **Parts fault** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| The EMU bogie | Wheelset | Wheel tread fault |\n| Wheel flange wearing |\n| Axle fault |\n| Brake disc fault |\n| Axle box and locating device | Axle box damage |\n| Axle box bearing failure |\n| Axle end-cover fault |\n| Axial positioning device fault |\n| Bogie frame | Frame weld opening, frame crack |\n| Frame deformation |\n| Mechanical drive unit | Gearbox fault |\n| Shaft coupling fault |\n| Traction motor fault |\n| Foundation brake unit | Brake pad fault |\n| Balance slide bar failure |\n| Bellow break |\n| Brake disc crack |\n| Brake cylinder fault |\n| Primary suspension | Axle box spring failure |\n| Rubber mat falling off |\n| Vertical damper fault |\n| Secondary suspension | Air spring fault |\n| Levelling valve fault |\n| Differential pressure valve fault |\n| Anti-roll bar fault |\n| Lateral damper fault |\n\nBased on the EMU bogie fault system in [Table 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0003), the bogie's structure and failure mode are analysed by applying [FMEA](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/failure-mode-analysis \"Learn more about FMEA from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") to construct the fault tree model of the EMU bogie (as shown in [Fig. 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#fig0005)). The symbol and definition of each event in the fault tree model are shown in [Table 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0004).\n\n![Fig 5](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0736584522001673-gr5.jpg)\n\n1.

Moreover, the text processing method in [Section 4.1.2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0010) is adopted to extract the _FSK_ and the possible fault causes of each sub-case library. Finally, a multi-level OM service case library is obtained. Detailed information is given in [Table 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0010) of the Appendix. Based on the bogie's multi-level OM service case library, the method in [Section 4.1.2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0010) is used to define and express the OM service case. As a result, the bogie OM service case structure can be represented as a table (as shown in [Table 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0005)).\n\nTable 5.

In particular, the detailed operation instructions of the suggested solution text can be provided in the maintenance operation structured files. For example, the information in maintenance operation structured files mainly includes maintenance task name, operation number, personnel and labour-hour, task description, spare parts, operation instruction text, etc. According to this information, maintenance instructions can be provided for field personnel.\n\n[Table 6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0006) shows an example of the original record of an EMU bogie OM service case. Based on the original case record, fault categories can be analysed and judged by the method of fault symptom keywords extracted introduced in [Section 4.1.2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0010). Finally, the OM service cases are expressed and managed by the structure represented in [Table 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0005), as shown in [Table 7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0007). This mode can be further used to provide knowledge support for the active pushing of personalised OM service schemes for bogie and to promote the achievement of knowledge reuse.\n\nTable 6.

Active pushing of OM service cases for bogie wheelset\n\nTaking the wheelset of the bogie for the H38L high-speed EMU as an example, the feasibility and effectiveness of the active pushing method of OM service cases are verified in this section. Given the equipment portrait model of the bogie is _M<sub>u</sub>_\\= {(_F_<sub>1</sub>, _E_<sub>1</sub>): _ω_<sub>1</sub>, (_F_<sub>2</sub>, _E_<sub>2</sub>): _ω_<sub>2</sub>, …, (_F<sub>n</sub>, E<sub>n</sub>_): _ω<sub>n</sub>_}, and assumed that (_F_<sub>1</sub>, _E_<sub>1</sub>) represents the fault category feature vector of the wheelset. When a certain fault of the wheelset occurred, the FRACAS will extract the portrait model of the wheelset and the sub-case library that corresponds to this fault type. Then, the similarity calculation instruction will be further triggered in the FRACAS to calculate the similarity between the fault category feature vector and OM service case in the sub-case library to get the best similarity cases. The best similar case corresponds to an OM service solution of the fault type for the bogie wheelset. Therefore, the suggested solution text should be extracted from the previously established OM service case library based on the occurred fault type.\n\nIn this application scenario, the fault feature vector of the wheelset in the target case is expressed as _F_<sub>1</sub>\\= {wheel tread scrape: 0.5, wheel indentation depth transfinite: 0.3, wheel wear: 0.2}. Furthermore, the attribute and behaviour feature vector are expressed as _E_<sub>1</sub>\\= {TT: H38L, TN: G372, TMN: 3736, CN: 02, mileage: 160,782, EAT: 27, TC: hills, RF or SF: yes, FC: wheelset fault, FP: wheel tread}. [Table 8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0008) shows the cases related to the fault case library of the EMU bogie wheelset. Meanwhile, [Table 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0011) of the Appendix shows the value types of the feature items of the EMU bogie fault case library.\n\nTable 8. Cases related to the fault case library of bogie wheelset.\n\n| **Feature items** | **Case 1** | **Case 2** | **Case 3** | **Case 4** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **F** | FSFV | {wheel rim crack: 0.7, wear: 0.3} | {wear: 0.3, sparking: 0.35, brake shoe deformation: 0.25} | {wheel tread scrape: 0.4, abnormal noise: 0.35, wear: 0.25} | {wheel tread scrape: 0.15, wheel tread peeling: 0.85} |\n| **E** | TT | H380L | H40F | H38L | H30C |\n| TN | G372 | G506 | G434 | G650 |\n| TMN | 3651 | 3013 | 3782 | 3023 |\n| CN | 02 | 06 | 03 | 07 |\n| Mi/km | 113,500 | 57,805 | 191,421 | 132,560 |\n| EAT/ °C | 12 | 20 | 30 | 26 |\n| TC | Hills | Plain | Plain | Hills |\n| RF or SF | No | No | Yes | Yes |\n| FC | Wheelset fault | Wheelset fault | Wheelset fault | Wheelset fault |\n| FP | Wheel rim | Wheel tread | Wheel tread | Wheel tread |\n| **Suggested solution** | This fault is caused by local material fatigue. If the wheel rim crack is not more than 80 mm, the train can directly run to the destination after inspecting and affirming by manage department. If the crack exceeds 80 mm, the carriage should be disengaged from the train immediately to ensure the safety of the whole EMU. | This fault is caused by the poor material of the brake pad. For example, the adhesive, filler or auxiliary material does not conform to regulation. The rail transit equipment company should strictly screen their suppliers and control the quality of parts. | The wheel tread scrape and wear are caused by the failure of the electronic antiskid device due to the excessive braking force of the train. The wheel lathe needs to be replaced and trimmed to the circular. Then repair the electronic antiskid device to work properly and avoid the wheel scrape. The fixed frequency abnormal noise is caused by local depression of the wheel tread due to the too-soft material of the wheelset and foreign object impact. This problem needs to be fed back to the wheelset supplier to adjust the material. | This fault is related to the material's low yield and tensile strength. The wheelset needs to be replaced. Then the wheel lathe needs to be trimmed to improve the smelting quality and to reduce the metal wear caused by tread peeling. |\n\nBy using the similarity calculation method in [Section 4.2.2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0017), four cases in [Table 8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0008) are matched. Meanwhile, the weight value of each feature item is {0.5, 0.05, 0.03, 0.01, 0.01, 0.1, 0.04, 0.03, 0.03, 0.1, 0.1}. That is, the weight ρF of _F_<sub>1</sub> is 0.5, and the weight ρE of _E_<sub>1</sub> is 0.5. Meanwhile, set the mileage range to \\[0, 1,800,000\\], the lower limit of operation environment temperature is −30 °C, and the upper limit is 40 °C. Finally, the case matching results ranked from high to low by global similarity is shown in [Table 9](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0009).\n\nTable 9. The OM case matching results.\n\n| The case number | The global similarity of case |\n| --- | --- |\n| Case 3 | 0.8165 |\n| Case 4 | 0.7158 |\n| Case 1 | 0.6971 |\n| Case 2 | 0.6372 |\n\nAs seen in [Table 9](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0009), Case 3 has the greatest global similarity. Therefore, Case 3 can be suggested and considered the best similar case for the target product, and its solution has the most reference value. And the solution of Case 3 can be pushed to field personnel, and then the OM service for the wheelset can be carried out following the generated maintenance operation structured files. However, the fault contained in the solution of case 3 is different from the target product. For example, there is no abnormal noise problem for the target product. Thereby, the personalised OM service solution for the target product does not contain measures for [noise cancellation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/noise-cancellation \"Learn more about noise cancellation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). That is, the suggested solution should be adjusted according to the actual OM situation through artificial intervention. As a result, the adjusted OM service scheme is replacing the wheel lathe and trimming it to the circular, repairing the electronic antiskid device to work normally, and avoiding the wheel scrape.\n\nThe above-mentioned processes illustrated that the way for the personnel to confirm or dismiss the usefulness of the suggested solution is involved and considered in the application scenario study. According to the method and process described in [Section 4.2.2.2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0019), experienced maintenance personnel will intervene in the judgement and [verification processes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/verification-process \"Learn more about verification processes from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of the usefulness of the OM service case. As a result, the edited and adjusted OM service case will be dynamically updated to the sub-case library. Therefore, if the suggested solution is not the right one, the FRACAS will generate and recommend the new solution through the OM service structured document platform based on personnel confirming and editing the solution content. The interviews confirmed that the partner company adopts the human-based manner to improve operational decision-making in maintenance service delivery processes based on the actual OM service situation. Feedback to improve and adjust the system-based solution proposal for the introduction of new ones according to the actual maintenance task is necessary.\n\n### 5.4. Analysis and discussions\n\nThe study of the application scenario provides strong evidence that the proposed approach is valid and feasible, which indicates that it has the potential to be applied in the industry field for product OM services. Compared with other research \\[[25](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0024),[26](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0025),[30](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0029)\\], the major difference is the novel combination of PSS and portrait technology with the possibility of acquiring more comprehensive lifecycle data and the advantage of describing personalised user requirements and providing refined product services.\n\nThe proposed novel POMA-CP based on equipment portrait within the PSS mode makes it possible to access the product data of different [lifecycle stages](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/lifecycle-stage \"Learn more about lifecycle stages from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and trace the business data of different stakeholders. For example, the product data at the beginning of life (design and manufacturing stages), middle of life (operation, service and maintenance stages) and end of life (remanufacturing, recycling, reuse), and the business data scattered in OEMs, component suppliers, maintenance service providers, product operators, etc. These data create effective means to enable inter-connect user needs, personalised OM and sustainable competitive advantage. For example, the abovementioned data can be analysed to construct the fine-grained label library and accurate portrait model to manage better and maintain complex products while improving different stakeholders’ business processes and decisions. As a result, the complex products can be run in a better state, thereby enhancing customer satisfaction and promoting user buyback and [user experience](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/user-experience \"Learn more about user experience from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). This would be a potential competitive advantage for OEMs and service providers.\n\nThe proposed approach, along with the multi-source data of different lifecycle stages and stakeholders, allows the service providers to find more hidden fault features and match more precise OM service schemes in a shorter time. This will contribute service providers to reducing maintenance costs and resource consumption, OEMs optimising product design and [manufacturing process](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/production-process \"Learn more about manufacturing process from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), and product users reducing safety risks caused by a sudden failure. Therefore, the PSS mode, rich data, and personalised OM approach are three significant pillars for exploring the potential of the equipment portrait for complex products. These three elements provide insights to service providers and OEMs to develop and implement [sustainable business models](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/sustainable-business-model \"Learn more about sustainable business models from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") in line with corporate social responsibility.\n\nAccording to the semi-structured interviews with the managers of the partner company, in the past, even though mainly operational data of the critical components for EMU bogie were collected and analysed, the deviation between the maintenance decision and task execution is often produced. This is mainly caused by the dynamic changing of bogie operational status, fuzzy relationship, and inconsistent data transmission amongst different lifecycle stages and stakeholders. By applying the novel OM approach with multi-source lifecycle data and dynamic attribute and behaviour label library, more fault features and knowledge were found to conduct targeted analysis on bogie's operational status and performance. Therefore, personalised, refined and active OM services can be carried out to ensure the safety and reliability of EMU. This can move the service providers from planned [corrective maintenance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/corrective-maintenance \"Learn more about corrective maintenance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") to proactive and condition-based OM service planning [\\[6\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0006), reducing the service providers’ [OM costs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/operation-and-maintenance-cost \"Learn more about OM costs from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and ensuring the customers’ safety. The managers of the partner company also emphasised that the schemes of the bogie OM service case for frequent faults can provide new ideas and insights for research and development of the next generation of the EMU bogie. Moreover, other potential benefits of the novel approach, such as the personalised and refined OM service for [product families](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/product-family \"Learn more about product families from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), can be realised because of the rich portrait models.\n\n## 6\\. Conclusions\n\nMany manufacturing enterprises of complex products have transformed their businesses towards PSS modes and have integrated user portraits with relevant OM services, which helps accelerate the transition of service mode to refined, differentiated, [personalised services](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/personalized-service \"Learn more about personalised services from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). As a result, the concept of equipment portrait has received increasing attention in complex products’ OM service studies. Meanwhile, the opportunities for OEMs to accurately describe personalised user demands by comprehensive collecting the data of PSS delivery processes for complex products are continuously increasing. However, with the [permeation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/permeation \"Learn more about permeation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and application of portrait technology in industrial and complex products’ OM service fields, OEMs are facing many challenges. For example, how should a prescriptive procedure for equipment portrait-based OM service delivery and execution processes of industrial complex products be structured, and how to effectively organise and reuse the knowledge extracted from the PSS delivery process data to support equipment portrait-based OM service decision-making?\n\nIn order to address the challenges, in this paper, a novel framework and solution of POMA-CP based on equipment portrait within the PSS mode was proposed. First, the proposed POMA-CP framework contributes to the research related to the investigation of a prescriptive and structured process for the implementation of the equipment portrait-based OM service decision-making. The framework answers RQ1 by guiding the industrial practitioners in exploiting data generated during the whole PSS delivery lifecycle to improve and optimise the OM service delivery and execution processes (e.g., personalised and refined OM service), then addressing one of the knowledge gaps identified from existing literature (as stated in paragraph 2 of [Section 2.3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0005)). Second, another knowledge gap identified from the literature review existed in the lack of approaches proposed for exploiting the integrated application of equipment portrait and PSS (as stated in paragraph 3 of [Section 2.3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0005)). The solution of POMA-CP contributes to addressing this gap and answers RQ2 by introducing a set of methods in each component aimed at organizing and managing the knowledge excavated from PSS delivery processes data to establish a precise portrait model, and support the industrial practitioners in personalised and refined OM service decision-making.\n\nThe limitations of this paper are summarised as follows. First, in the application scenario, only one case record (see [Table 6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0006)) and one bogie (see [Table 8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0008)) for a specific EMU was used to test the effectiveness of the active pushing mechanism of the OM service solution. To strengthen the applicability and robustness of the proposed approach, different components for this application scenario and different types of EMU bogies as well as different operational conditions (or case records) should be considered and tested comprehensively. Second, when organising and expressing the OM service case of EMU bogie, only ten mainly features (see [Table 7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0007)) that reflect bogie fault features were selected to construct the attribute and behaviour feature vector. In order to improve the efficiency and accuracy of case matching, more features should be selected and considered to enrich the case library's information and provide more fine-grained information or knowledge for personalised and refined OM services. Third, the system-based and human-based manner are combined together in the application scenario study to generate the best similarity cases and to suggest the final OM service solutions. However, the validation test comparing human-based and system-based solution proposals and the time required to evaluate the proposed solution were not performed in this work.\n\nFuture research will focus on the following three aspects. First, the labels used to establish the equipment portrait model will dynamically change along with the different operational conditions of complex products. Therefore, a periodic updating mechanism (as stated in [Section 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0006)) of the equipment portrait model should be investigated to implement more refined OM services. Second, with the ever-increasing accumulation of equipment operational data and OM service abnormal event log text, more advanced algorithms should be considered to improve the accuracy of fault symptom keywords extracting and fault cause identification (as stated in [Section 4.2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0013)). Third, more abundant similarity calculation methods for different types of label values (as stated in [Section 4.2.2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0017)) should be developed and involved to maximise historical OM service knowledge's [reusability](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/reusability \"Learn more about reusability from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and enhance the precision of OM service case-pushing and scheme decision-making.\n\n## CRediT authorship contribution statement\n\n**Shan Ren:** Writing – original draft, Methodology, Software. **Lichun Shi:** Methodology, Software. **Yang Liu:** Supervision, Validation, Writing – review & editing. **Weihua Cai:** [Data curation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/data-curation \"Learn more about Data curation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). **Yingfeng Zhang:** Supervision, Validation.\n\n## Declaration of Competing Interest\n\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. [52005408](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#gs0001) and [U2001201](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#gs0001)) and the Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi ([2021GY-069](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#gs0002)).\n\n## Appendix\n\nTable A.1.

T…\n\n---\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nComponents in civil infrastructure systems, such as bridges, pipes, and electric wires, deteriorate over the life cycle of the systems due to corrosion of materials and other environmental factors. Component failures caused by the degradation may trigger a system-level failure event, e.g., [power outage](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/power-outage \"Learn more about power outage from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), service disruption, loss of network connectivity, or degenerate the systems’ the quality of service (QoS) like usability and [serviceability](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/serviceability \"Learn more about serviceability from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") [\\[1\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0001). Since civil infrastructure systems, especially lifeline systems including power, water, or gas transmission systems, have a great impact on [modern societies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/modern-society \"Learn more about modern societies from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), not only can each failure cause huge socio-economic losses, but system-level malfunctions multiply the damage exponentially. To quantify the risk uncertainty of these system elements, numerous studies on risk modeling based on stochastic processes have been conducted \\[[2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0002),[3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0003)\\]. Based on these modeled risk, decision-makers should establish apposite risk-informed operation and maintenance (O&M) policies considering the inevitable changes in system-level QoS and the consequences of system failure \\[[2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0002),[4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0004)\\].\n\nVarious O&M strategies have been developed for structures in civil lifeline systems. For example, time-based maintenance (TBM) undertakes maintenance based on the predetermined repair time intervals, i.e., without monitoring or criteria evaluation \\[[5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0005),[6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0006)\\]. On the other hand, condition-based maintenance (CBM) aims to perform [preventive maintenance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/preventive-maintenance \"Learn more about preventive maintenance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") based on the information acquired or interpreted in various forms \\[[6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0006),[7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0007),[8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0008),[9](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0009)\\]. Although it is straightforward to scale and apply these O&M schemes to multiple components, the introduction of exogenous variables such as the cost of system failure events hampers their direct extensions to system-level decision-making processes. This is because component-level [optimality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/optimality \"Learn more about optimality from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") does not ensure the optimal decisions at the system level [\\[10\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0010). Therefore, stakeholders and decision-makers of civil lifeline systems should be able to establish an O&M policy based on the system-level performance rather than on the conditions of individual components during the life cycle.\n\nFor O&M policy planning for a system consisting of components subject to uncertain failures, classical theories of system reliability \\[[11](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0011),[12](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0012),[13](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0013)\\] often introduce a Markovian model to handle the characteristics of the components and the system. If the same system control policy is applied over the life cycle, stationary conditions are achieved after a warm-up period. Thus, the system availability can be expressed as a closed-form expression under the assumption that components have constant mean failure rates [\\[13\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0013). However, such an O&M policy based on the steady-state assumption is not flexible enough to cope with many plausible exceptions in practice, e.g., an old road facing its service life.\n\nIn efforts to obtain optimal O&M decisions without special assumptions such as steady-state conditions in a finite time horizon, a [Markov decision process](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/markov-decision-process \"Learn more about Markov decision process from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") (MDP) has been considered as a preferred framework to formulate the stochastic processes of [structural deterioration](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/structural-deterioration \"Learn more about structural deterioration from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and the risk-informed O&M optimization. Because of the capability to quantify the expected cost or value of various maintenance actions in each state through [dynamic programming](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/dynamic-programming \"Learn more about dynamic programming from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), MDPs have been applied to establish the O&M policies for multi-state systems \\[[14](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0014),[15](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0015)\\] as well as component-level policies [\\[16\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0016) for civil infrastructures. Although MDPs have a fundamental limit in direct applications to large systems due to the curse of dimensionality, i.e., the state and action spaces increase exponentially with the number of the components, researchers have proposed relaxing constraints or seeking approximate solutions \\[[17](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0017),[18](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0018)\\].\n\nIn particular, to overcome the challenges, recent studies have applied many deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithms \\[[19](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0019),[20](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0020),[21](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0021),[22](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0022)\\] to maintenance optimization problems in civil infrastructure systems \\[[23](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0023),[24](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0024),[25](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0025)\\]. More specifically, Yang et al. [\\[26\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0026) utilized a deep Q-learning (DQN) framework for the optimal CBM planning of a multi-state system, and the framework has been further refined with the introduction of double DQN (DDQN) \\[[27](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0027),[28](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0028),[29](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0029)\\]. Moreover, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) \\[[30](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0030),[31](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0031),[32](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0032),[33](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0033)\\], in which multiple agents learn policies to achieve the minimum costs using DRL, has been considered to improve the scalability of DRL applications for optimizing the maintenance of civil systems. For example, Andriotis and Papakonstantinou \\[[10](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0010),[34](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0034)\\] have developed centralized or decentralized MARL-based algorithms, respectively, in terms of sharing or not sharing parameters related to each agent's policy for large civil systems. Zhou et al. [\\[35\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0035) also proposed MARL-based hierarchical algorithms to optimize the O&M decisions of large-scale multi-component systems. To enhance the performance of MARL, Nguyen et al. [\\[36\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0036) introduced a value decomposition network (VDN) algorithm \\[[32](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0032),[37](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0037)\\], decomposing the centralized Q-value into the sum of decentralized Q-values defined for individual agents, to find the best O&M decisions. However, although these MARL algorithms successfully reduce the computational complexity, model training or hyperparameter tuning still requires considerable time even in the relaxed environment. In the numerical examples where the existing MARL methods are applied, the topologies are quite monotonous, such as series- or parallel-systems, and the number of components is also limited.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a parallelized multi-agent deep Q-network (PM-DQN), a divide-and-conquer algorithm that utilizes clustering-based multi-scale approaches \\[[38](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0038),[39](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0039)\\], for risk-informed decision optimization of multi-state flow systems by combining the system simplification with MARL based on parallel processing. In PM-DQN, the agents observe the states of multiple subsystems identified by clustering, and learn decentralized policies to minimize the factorized cost for subsystems. The algorithm guides the decentralized policies chosen by the agents toward the system-level optimality by repeating the learning process through parallel processing and tuning a key hyperparameter based on the results with less computational cost. As a result, the PM-DQN can efficiently manage large systems that are out of control in existing approaches.\n\nThis paper is organized as follows. [Section 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0002) provides a description of the problem setting and the model assumptions for numerical examples, discusses the system-level sequential decision-making optimization problem, and introduces the DDQN and MARL frameworks. [Section 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0010) proposes the PM-DQN algorithm based on the configuration of subsystems based on community detection and the cost factorization. The efficiency and superior performance of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated by numerical examples in [Section 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0014), followed by a summary and concluding remarks in [Section 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0017).\n\n## 2\\. Background information\n\n### 2.1. Problem statement\n\n#### 2.1.1. Descriptions of system state\n\nIn this study, we consider a multi-state flow system with components. It is assumed that the initial state of each component is intact, i.e., as-good-as-new (AGAN) state. The degradation level of components is identified as one of the following discretized damage states through annual observations: _AGAN, slight damage, moderate damage, extensive damage,_ and _collapse_. We assume that the system state is observed without errors. The [system degradation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/degradation-system \"Learn more about system degradation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") state is given as a vector of component states, where is the state of component at time\n\nAs a performance indicator, the maximum flow capacity between two predetermined terminals is used to quantify the QoS of the system. It is assumed that the flow capacity of all components depends on each state as shown in [Table 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#tbl0001). Once the flow capacities of all components are determined, i.e., the system state is observed, the loss of the system QoS, can be calculated as the difference between the current maximum flow capacity and the maximum flow capacity under the initial system state through the max-flow algorithm \\[[1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0001),[40](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0040),[41](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0041)\\]. Depending on the topology of the system, each component's flow capacity loss due to the deterioration has a different effect on the QoS of the system.\n\nTable 1. Flow capacity of each component for each damage state.\n\n| Damage state | AGAN | Slight | Moderate | Extensive | Collapse |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Flow Capacity | 1.00 | 0.95 | 0.50 | 0.25 | 0 |\n\n#### 2.1.2. Descriptions of maintenance and degradation process\n\nBased on the system state information, the agent chooses one of the two options for O&M action for the component at time i.e., ‘Do Nothing (_DN_)’ and ‘Repair it to AGAN state (_R_).’ System-level action is defined as a vector of the actions taken for individual components. Although the size of the action space seems small at the component level, the number of system-level actions that a decision-maker considers each year is which increases exponentially with the number of components.\n\nWe assume that there is no limit to the number of components that can be repaired per step. When the decision-maker selects _R_ for one component, the state becomes the AGAN state deterministically, otherwise it remains the same or deteriorates with a certain probability called state-transition probability The stochastic [degradation process](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/degradation-process \"Learn more about degradation process from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of individual components is modeled as an independent discrete-time Markov process. That is, the state-transition probability for component depends only on the current state and action due to its [Markov properties](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/markov-property \"Learn more about Markov properties from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). While the state-transition probabilities for _R_ are the same for all components, the state-transition probabilities for _DN_ are modeled in two ways depending on the component types, each shown as matrices in the [Appendix A](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0019). Once the system-level action for all components is determined in system state we can define the system-level state-transition probability based on the state-transition probabilities for all components.\n\n#### 2.1.3. Descriptions of operation and maintenance costs\n\nIn the O&M process of civil lifeline systems, various variables (e.g., maintenance costs, system QoS, component malfunction) must be considered simultaneously at each time step. Because of trade-offs between life-cycle costs and the risk of systems, there is often no single solution that optimizes all these variables simultaneously. It is necessary to find an appropriate compromise among the conflicting goals. In multi-objective optimization, one can explore Pareto-optimal solutions that cannot improve an objective function without degrading other objective functions [\\[42\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0042). However, to make a decision among Pareto-optimal solutions, the subjective preference of decision-makers must intervene inevitably.\n\nOne can handle this issue by transforming multiple objective functions into a single objective function through scalarization, i.e., the weighted sum formulation. In this approach, the optimal solution strongly depends on cost functions (or utility functions) used in the scalarization process. In this paper, the objective function which is the total cost at time is defined as the sum of the multiple objective functions scaled to cost as follows:(1)where is the maintenance cost for the component is the cost due to the shutdown of the component and is the system damage cost caused by the loss of system QoS. In [Eq. (1)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0001), conflicts with the other operation costs; and which depend on the state of components and system, decrease with a conservative O&M decision, while incurred by repairs increases. Therefore, a suitable compromise between these costs is desirable.\n\nIn numerical examples in [Section 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0014), it is assumed that the maintenance cost of 1.0 is imposed when is _R_ regardless of and the shutdown cost of 1.0 is charged when component reached the collapse state. Loss of the system QoS, penalizes the system damage cost by a factor of as(2)where is a function representing the maximum flow capacity between predetermined two terminals under system state and is the initial system state vector, i.e., every component is in AGAN state.\n\nIf the term in [Eq. (1)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0001) is neglected, i.e., the objective function is given as a linear function of the component-level costs, the system-level optimization problem is decomposed into multiple component-level optimization problems. The optimal solutions to the [subproblems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/subproblem \"Learn more about subproblems from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") provide the system-level optimum. In most cases, however, given as a function of component state combinations is of great interest. Therefore, the objective function cannot be decomposed into component-level decentralized costs. In other words, the number of combinable policies to explore for achieving a system-level optimal solution grows exponentially with the system size.\n\n### 2.2. System-level sequential maintenance optimization\n\nIn maintenance optimization problems for civil lifeline system, the agent's goal is to determine a policy as a mapping from the state to the action to minimize the Q-value, defined as the expected total discounted costs to the system's lifespan as(3)where is the discount factor to convert future costs into present values. Just as the component-level [optimality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/optimality \"Learn more about optimality from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") does not guarantee the system-level optimality, a greedy optimal decision at every time step cannot assure optimality over the long run in a finite-time horizon environment. This applies to sequential maintenance optimization problems for civil lifeline system O&M throughout the life cycle. An O&M policy is defined to be better than or equal to another O&M policy if and only if its expected cost is smaller than or equal to that of for all states [\\[43\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0043). That is, the optimal O&M policy leads the Q-value to its minimum.\n\nIn value iteration \\[[43](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0043),[44](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0044)\\], considering this point, the Q-value is updated by continuously choosing the action with the lowest Q-value as(4)\n\nAfter initializing all the Q-value estimates to zero, the values are updated iteratively according to the following Bellman equation:(5)where is the Q-value on state and action estimated at the iteration. The value [iteration algorithm](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/iteration-algorithm \"Learn more about iteration algorithm from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") works well in simple environments but does not apply to environments with large state and action spaces. In particular, evaluating the Q-value of every combinable state-action pair in complex environments is nearly impossible.\n\n### 2.3. Double Deep Q-Network with prioritized experience replay\n\nTo overcome the computational limitation, Watkins and Dayan [\\[22\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0022) proposed to apply a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm called Q-learning. In the Q-learning algorithm, instead of [Eq. (5)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0005), the following equation is used to update Q-values iteratively:(6)where is the learning rate; and is the target value.\n\nThe \\-greedy algorithm is often implemented to expedite the exploration and exploitation process for Q-learning [\\[43\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0043). In detail, after initializing Q-value to zero, an agent selects a random action (i.e., exploration) with probability or the action minimizing Q-value (i.e., exploitation) with probability It is common to start with the value of close to 1 and gradually decrease it as information about the environment accumulates.\n\nIn a powerful deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework developed by Mnih et al. \\[[19](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0019),[20](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0020)\\], a parameterized deep Q-network (DQN) is introduced to approximate the Q-value. Each layer in the DQN outputs a [linear combination](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/linear-combination \"Learn more about linear combination from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of inputs and parameters. The framework introduces [activation functions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/activation-function \"Learn more about activation functions from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") between layers, such as rectified linear unit (ReLU), exponential linear unit (ELU), and scaled ELU (SELU), to describe the complex relationships beyond linearity. However, DQN tends to underestimate the Q-values in stochastic environments due to the ‘min’ operator in calculating the target value Double DQN (DDQN) [\\[27\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0027) performs the action selection and Q-value evaluation separately using two different DQNs (i.e., online and target networks), thereby avoiding the underestimation of the Q-values and stabilizing the learning process. The target value is rewritten as(7)where is the Q-value estimated using the online network with parameters and is the Q-value estimated using the target network with parameters respectively. The parameters are periodically updated to the parameters every steps.\n\nIn addition, one can introduce the experience replay [\\[45\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0045), in which agents store the experiences as tuples in a replay buffer and update the online network parameters based on a batch of uniformly sampled tuples from the replay buffer. The uniformly drawn samples significantly reduce the variance of updates owing to the weakened correlation, thereby suppressing the oscillation or divergence of the parameters during the training process. Combining these techniques, DDQN calculates the loss function and updates the online network parameters to minimize by the [gradient descent](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/gradient-descent \"Learn more about gradient descent from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") as follows:(8)(9)where represents a uniform distribution over the replay buffer and is a batch of the tuples sampled from\n\nAgents can gauge the importance of each experience by the temporal difference error (TD-error), i.e., the difference between the expected Q-values before and after the experience. In prioritized experience replay (PER) \\[[46](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0046)\\], the alternative sampling density of a batch of experience tuples which was uniformly distributed, is given as:(10)where is the TD-error; and is an importance sampling hyperparameter, with corresponding to the existing experience replay. The loss function in [Eq. (8)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0008) can be calculated more efficiently using importance sampling as follows:(11)where denotes the probability mass function of the discrete uniform distribution; and is the likelihood ratio to compensate for the bias caused by introducing the alternative sampling density The initial learning process is highly non-stationary because the online and target networks have not been trained enough. Therefore, even if the estimate is slightly biased, stabilization should be the top priority at the beginning phase of learning, and importance sampling correction may be considered later. To this end, in [Eq. (11)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0011) is replaced by , defined as(12)where is the number of experiences in the replay buffer and is a hyperparameter controlling how much to compensate for the bias. As is gradually annealed toward 1.0, starting from a low value (e.g., typically around 0.4 to 0.6), the bias is completely compensated. When combined, DDQN and PER exert a substantial [synergistic effect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/synergistic-effect \"Learn more about synergistic effect from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), thereby neutralizing a significant portion of the existing limitations of Q-learning algorithms.\n\n### 2.4. Factorization in multi-agent reinforcement learning\n\nIn addition to increasing the efficiency of DRL like DDQN with PER, dividing the original problem into multiple subproblems can be a more effective solution to overcome the curse of dimensionality caused by the exponentially increasing number of states and actions. A divide-and-conquer strategy called a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) deploys multiple agents in each segmented state and action spaces, and the agents learn policies to achieve the minimum costs independently or through cooperation.\n\nIf there are no cost functions that agents jointly contribute, a given environment can be simplified by decomposing it into several smaller independent environments \\[[30](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0030),[47](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0047)\\]. In other words, the optimal decision set in sub-problems yields the same solution as the optimal global decision-making. Then, the size of the action space is shrunk from to where is the number of agents, and is redefined as the number of available actions for the agent. As a result, one can handle environments with large spaces of states and actions based on the large scalability.\n\nHowever, in most of complex environments, cost functions take a combination of various states and actions as input, e.g., [Eq. (1)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0001). This leads to the multi-agent credit allocation problem [\\[33\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0033), in which the contributions of individual agents to the cost function must be accurately inferred. To this end, the problem can be segmented into multiple independent environments by factorizing the centralized cost into the sum of decentralized costs through [neural networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/neural-network \"Learn more about neural networks from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") called value decomposition networks (VDNs) [\\[32\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0032) or user-defined functions. No matter how sophisticated the original cost is segmented, accuracy loss is inevitable during the [factorization process](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/factorization-process \"Learn more about factorization process from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), thereby resulting in a trade-off between accuracy and scalability.\n\n## 3\\. Proposed algorithm: parallelized multi-agent deep Q-network (PM-DQN)\n\nThe MARL method combined with DDQN and PER improves the scalability with minimal loss of accuracy, allowing the MDP framework to be applied to complex environments. However, as the number of components in the system increases, the accuracy loss of the MARL method gradually accumulates, eventually leading to a failure in [optimal policy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/optimal-policy \"Learn more about optimal policy from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") search. To alleviate the scalability issue, in this section, we propose a novel MARL algorithm termed “Parallelized Multi-agent Deep Q-Network” (PM-DQN), which assigns multiple agents to subsystems based on community detection, and makes the agents explore decentralized cost-minimizing policies under various hyperparameter values in multiple processing units. The proposed algorithm consists of three steps differentiated from others as follows: (1) system simplification based on network clustering for effective agent allocation, (2) factorization of centralized costs based on a predefined function, and (3) the hyperparameter tuning with parallel processing. [Fig. 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0002)(a) and (b) respectively illustrate the proposed algorithm's microscopic and macroscopic structures of operations.\n\n![Fig 2](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S095183202300426X-gr2.jpg)\n\n1.

(a) Learning process using DDQN with PER in a processing unit, and (b) overall procedure of Parallelized Multi-agent Deep Q-Network (PM-DQN) algorithm.\n\n### 3.1. Step 1: identification of subsystems based on community detection\n\nIn optimizing MARL-based O&M strategies in large-scale systems, it is necessary to find an appropriate balance between minimizing accuracy loss and efficient reduction of the state and action spaces. To this end, we propose a decomposition of the system into a few subsystems, i.e., communities of components. By grouping deeply related components in terms of functionality or densely connected components into one subsystem, the existing system can be simplified into another system of subsystems. This can also lower computational complexity that may scale exponentially with the number of components, while minimizing loss of information. Various algorithms such as spectral [clustering algorithms](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/clustering-algorithm \"Learn more about clustering algorithms from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") \\[[38](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0038),[48](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0048)\\] and Markov clustering algorithm \\[[49](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0049),[50](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0050)\\] have been proposed for community detection. In this paper, the target system is represented by subsystems instead of the existing components based on the Girvan-Newman algorithm \\[[39](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0039),[51](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0051)\\].\n\nThe Girvan-Newman algorithm sequentially removes edges with the highest edge-betweenness, which means the probability that the shortest paths between all node pairs in the graph go through the edge [\\[52\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0052). As edges with high edge-betweenness are removed, the entire graph representing the system is divided into several isolated clusters, and the process of edge removal ends when all edges are removed. In Girvan-Newman algorithm, the modularity is introduced to stop the process at an appropriate time [\\[51\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0051). The modularity represents the difference between the actual number of intra-cluster edges in the existing graph and the expected number of intra-cluster edges when reconstructing the graph while preserving the degree of each node, and is defined as(13)where is the number of isolated clusters; is the number of edges in the graph; is the number of intra-cluster edges in cluster and is the sum of degrees of the nodes in cluster Modularity is updated whenever an edge is removed, and when it is maximized, one can identify subsystems that are separated from each other.\n\nOnce subsystems in the target system are identified using the Girvan-Newman algorithm, we can assign an agent to learn the O&M strategy of each subsystem. However, there is a problem in utilizing the community detection result for PM-DQN; since all agents must be trained for optimal decision-making for the system-level optimal policy, the convergence of PM-DQN is governed by the slowest learning rate among agents (generally the agent with the largest state and action spaces). If components are concentrated in specific clusters, the learning time of the agents increases exponentially, thereby leading to a decrease in learning efficiency of PM-DQN. Therefore, a procedure for adjusting the subsystems to an even size is necessary. To this end, after initial grouping based on the Girvan-Newman algorithm, some components in the largest subsystem are reallocated to other neighboring subsystems. In this process, the number of edges connecting subsystems should be minimized to prevent loss of calculation accuracy due to system simplification.\n\n[Fig. 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0003) shows a simplified California gas distribution system (modified from [\\[53\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0053)) with 48 gas [substations](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/substations \"Learn more about substations from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of two types and 60 bidirectional pipelines. It is assumed that the pipelines are intact during the lifetime of the system, and only the deterioration of the gas substations, whose states can be periodically identified, is considered. The system can be described by a graph model with 48 nodes and 60 edges. [Table 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#tbl0002) shows how modularity and the number of detected clusters change with edge removal by the Girvan-Newman algorithm. As the edges are removed continuously, the number of clusters increases, but the modularity peaks at 8 clusters. However, the detected clusters consist of five to seven components as shown in [Fig. 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0004)(a), resulting in differences in the action space of the agents. Since the learning rate of the agent managing the largest subsystem is lower than that of the other agents, the benefits of parallel processing in simultaneous training of all agents can be underutilized. To compensate for this limitation, one component is reallocated from the largest subsystem to the neighboring smallest subsystem 3 as shown in [Fig. 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0004)(b), making the number of components within subsystems as uniform as possible. In contrast to the previous subsystems in [Fig. 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0004)(a), all subsystems in [Fig. 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0004)(b) consist of the same number of components, so the learning rate of the agent is expected to be similar. The needs for this procedure are discussed through numerical examples in [Section 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0014) by comparing the learning efficiency with or without the reallocation.\n\n![Fig 3](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S095183202300426X-gr3.jpg)\n\n1.

(a) Subsystems detected by Girvan-Newman algorithm, and (b) subsystems with uniformly reallocated components.\n\n### 3.2. Step 2: factorization of centralized costs\n\nAfter assigning one agent to each subsystem detected in Step 1, multiple agents make O&M decisions by comprehensively considering the state of components within each subsystem. To carry out the decision making independently but efficiently for all subsystems, the total cost should be factorized into individual subsystems based on effective multi-agent credit allocation. For example, the total cost in [Eq. (1)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0001) is divided into two parts: decentralized costs (e.g., and and centralized costs (e.g., Since decentralized costs obviously arise from each component, it makes sense to impose the sum of decentralized costs of the components in a subsystem to the corresponding agent. However, allocating the centralized cost to individual agents requires the introduction of VDN or predefined functions. To this end, PM-DQN finds the subsystems that are presumed to cause the loss of system, and selectively allocates centralized costs to those subsystems based on a predefined function. More specifically, by splitting the centralized cost and summing up the decentralized costs, the total decentralized cost for subsystem is expressed as(14)where is redefined as the action chosen by agent at time is the factorized cost transferred from the centralized cost to subsystem and is the hyperparameter that determines the weight of the factorized cost. The factorized cost is predefined as follows:(15)where is the QoS loss in the subsystem; and is a subset of which is the state vector of components belonging to the subsystem. While is calculated based on the maximum flow capacity between two predetermined terminals, is defined as the difference between the total inflow and outflow of the subsystem. The structure of [Eq. (15)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0015) is similar to that of [Eq. (2)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0002) before factorization, but individual agents infer the causality between QoS losses of system and their subsystems using the min operator.\n\nUsing [Eqs. (6)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0006), [(7)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0007), [(14)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0014), and [(15)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0015), one can calculate individual Q-values for each agent In this paper, we utilize the DDQN combined with PER (introduced in [Section 2.3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0008)) for more efficient and stable Q-learning. More specifically, the online network with parameters and the target network with parameters for take the system state vector and the current time step as inputs, and respectively output the Q-values and according to each action in the form of vectors. Then, the optimal action based on the estimated is converted into an \\-dimensional one-hot encoding vector, which is multiplied with the vector form of to update the online Q-value. Unlike these online parameters that are updated every step, the target network parameters are periodically updated to the online parameters every steps. It should be noted that, unlike VDN, the expected total life-cycle cost of the system is not equal to the sum of those caused by the factorized costs [\\[37\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0037). As all agents choose the actions that minimize their respective the system-level action set is redefined as(16)\n\nIn the learning process of DDQN, the performance of the PM-DQN depends significantly on the hyperparameter in [Eq. (14)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0014). Therefore, the hyperparameter value should be appropriately determined depending on the environment (e.g., system topologies, O&M costs, discount factor In addition, there is no way to find the optimal value analytically, while heuristics require substantial computational costs for\n\n### 3.3. Step 3: parallel processing-based hyperparameter tuning\n\nFor effective hyperparameter tuning, we introduce parallel processing in the proposed algorithm. Processing units (e.g., CPUs or GPUs) are classified into five groups with different hyperparameter values. In each unit, agents explore the optimal decentralized policies using the \\-greedy algorithm simultaneously under each given hyperparameter as illustrated in [Fig. 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0002)(a). After training agents for a sufficiently large number of epochs, called a cycle, one can judge the superiority of policies based on hyperparameter values through the expected total life-cycle costs Prior to the next cycle, the parameters of the online and target networks in all processing units, and for are synchronized with those showing the best performance in the previous cycle, as shown in [Fig. 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0002)(b), thereby contributing to improving the master policy. Through the synchronization process, some rarely explored near-optimal policies can be propagated to other processing units, resulting in significant performance gains. Then, hyperparameter is tuned as follows:(17)where is an exponentially decaying step size; and In addition, when the expected life-cycle cost has sufficiently converged through comparison of results of the parallel processing, the algorithm is terminated early. [Algorithm 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#tbl0010) provides a pseudo-code of the proposed PM-DQN algorithm.\n\nAlgorithm 1.

For stochastic [gradient descent](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/gradient-descent \"Learn more about gradient descent from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") on the network parameter space, we use the Nesterov-accelerated Adaptive Moment Estimation (Nadam) optimizer [\\[57\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0057), combining the Adaptive Movement Estimation (Adam) with Nesterov momentum [\\[58\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0058). DDQNs explore and exploit complex environments using the ε\\-greedy algorithm mentioned in [Section 2.3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0008), where the exploration probability ε decreases from 0.5 to 0 for every cycle along with the [cosine function](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/cosine-function \"Learn more about cosine function from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") [\\[59\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0059). For model training based on parallel processing on multiple processors, the multiprocessing library [\\[60\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0060) is implemented. [Appendix B](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0020) provides more detailed information about hyperparameters for PM-DQN.\n\nSince it is intractable to obtain the [optimal policy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/optimal-policy \"Learn more about optimal policy from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") for these examples due to the curse of dimensionality, two conventional O&M schemes and two MARL methods are also implemented as baseline policies as follows to confirm the superior performance of the PM-DQN:\n\n-   •\n    \n    Condition-based maintenance (CBM): agents repair components that have deteriorated below optimized threshold states. Since the number of all combinable threshold cases is exponentially proportional to the number of components n, it is extremely time-consuming to evaluate the system life-time cost for all policies. In numerical examples, the optimal threshold state set is explored through iterations that sequentially update the optimal threshold state of each component that minimizes the system life-cycle cost. The number of threshold combinations per iteration scales linearly with the number of components.\n    \n-   •\n    \n    Time-based maintenance (TBM): agents periodically repair individual components, regardless of their state, at certain time intervals optimized for each component. To find the optimal repair intervals, we use iterations in the same form as CBM's policy exploration.\n    \n-   •\n    \n    Subsystem-level optimal maintenance (SOM): agents assigned to subsystems independently learn policies to minimize the cost of each subsystem in [Eq. (14)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0014), where the factorized centralized cost cf,j(St) depends only on the QoS loss in the jth subsystem, cf,jSOM(Stj)\\=fSD·Lj(Stj), instead of [Eq. (15)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0015). Other than the factorized cost, the identified subsystems to which agents are assigned and the hyperparameters in [Appendix B](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0020) are shared with PM-DQN.\n    \n-   •\n    \n    Deep Centralized Multi-agent Actor Critic (DCMAC) [\\[10\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0010): agents learn policies based on two separate [neural networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/neural-network \"Learn more about neural networks from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), called actor-critic methods, each approximating a centralized policy function and the expected total life-cycle costs. Actions on individual components are learned conditionally independent of each other. The details of structures and hyperparameters tuned for DCMAC in each numerical examples are given in [Appendix B](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0020). In Example 2, to shorten the training time and streamline the process of efficiently exploring learning rates for actor and critic networks, parallelized DCMAC is introduced with periodic synchronization and compared to single-processing DCMAC.\n    \n\n### 4.1. Example 1: multi-state general system with 15 components\n\nA 15-component system is represented as a _general_ system, i.e., not series- or parallel-system, in [Fig. 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0005). All components are assumed to be Type I. The system QoS is defined as the maximum flow capacity MFsys between both left and right sides, which is 2.0 when all components operate in the AGAN state. As indicated by the hatched blocks in [Fig. 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0005), three subsystems of five components are detected based on the Girvan-Newman algorithm. By grouping components, the size of the action space is shrunk from 215\\=32,768 to 3×25\\=96, since the three agents only share information about the system state St and select actions atj for j∈\\[1,3\\] independently.\n\n![Fig 5](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S095183202300426X-gr5.jpg)\n\n1.

A general system with 15 multi-state components, simplified by three subsystems.\n\nBefore comparing the results of the proposed algorithm with those of the four baseline policies, we discuss the appropriateness of periodic synchronization in the PM-DQN. [Table 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#tbl0003) shows the average life-cycle costs and 95% confidence intervals of the realization of the policies trained on parallel units with and without periodic synchronization in the PM-DQN. The mean converges rapidly to the optimal life-cycle cost when accompanied by periodic synchronization. The standard deviation also decreases significantly, and the [coefficient of variation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/coefficient-of-variation \"Learn more about coefficient of variation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") (c.o.v.) is less than 1% after the fourth cycle (i.e., 4,000 epochs), at which hyperparameter ω is tuned around the optimal value of 4.75. Since the step size λ\\=0.25 is already small enough, the expected life-cycle cost of the policy explored at this time does not have a large difference from the optimal life-cycle cost after the 10th cycle. That is, when the step size and c.o.v. are sufficiently small (e.g., less than 0.5 and 1%, respectively), the algorithm can be terminated early without significant loss in terms of performance compared to when it progressed to the end. On the other hand, with single-cycle learning, although learning through the same number of epochs, the life-cycle cost estimates have a significant variance, and the mean cost is also higher than that of periodic synchronization. This inferior performance arises because there is no chance to tune the hyperparameter ω and explore good policies in many ways. Some outliers inevitably occur during parallel processing, but there are no other means for correcting them. Conversely, even if one or two learners find a rare near-optimal policy, these policies are not propagated to most computational resources and are not further developed.\n\nTable 3. Expected life-cycle costs and 95% confidence intervals of realization of the trained policies with and without periodic synchronization in PM-DQN.\n\n| Number of Epochs | w/ Periodic Sync | w/o Periodic Sync |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1,000 | 46.04±35.99 |  |\n| 2,000 | 33.65±3.44 |  |\n| 4,000 | 29.05±0.48 |  |\n| 6,000 | 28.71±0.53 |  |\n| 10,000 | 28.33±0.54 | 40.99±20.20 |\n\nIn this example, 5×15\\=75 and 50×15\\=750 combinations of threshold state and time interval sets are explored to optimize CBM and TBM, respectively, through five iterations. As a result, the optimal threshold state set for CBM and the repair interval set for TBM are determined, as shown in [Appendix C](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0021). In contrast, since MARL methods including SOM, PM-DQN, and DCMAC take the state combination of the components in a subsystem or a system or centralized costs as input, it is difficult to specify the damage state at which agents repair individual components. The performances of baselines and the proposed policy are estimated through 1,000 demonstrations in terms of the total life-cycle costs ctot, and the results are summarized in [Table 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#tbl0004) with the time required for iterative operation or model training. The TBM policy was evaluated as the most ineffective one due to the stochastic environment. Although the SOM shares the subsystems and hyperparameters for model learning with PM-DQN, each agent learns the subsystem-level optimal policy, resulting in higher life-cycle costs than PM-DQN at the system level. On the other hand, the optimal policy learned by the PM-DQN shows the lowest estimated life-cycle cost, which is almost identical to those of the optimal policies proposed by CBM and DCMAC. Comparing the computational time among them, the advantage of PM-DQN in computational efficiency becomes clear. CBM takes 3.5 times longer than the computational time of PM-DQN, even though search of all combinations is replaced with iterations. Although DCMAC requires about 47.5x more learning time than PM-DQN due to the difference in the number of processors, it can be shortened through parallelization and the improved convergence speed is compared on the complex system in Example 2.\n\nTable 4. Life-cycle costs and computational time of PM-DQN and four baselines for Example 1.\n\n| Method | Total life-cycle cost | Time (_sec_) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| CBM | 28.42 | 9,323 |\n| TBM | 56.71 | 99,174 |\n| SOM | 35.41 | 2,523 |\n| DCMAC (single processing) | 28.57 | 125,773 |\n| **PM-DQN** | **28.33** | **2,647** |\n\n[Fig. 6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0006)(a) and (b) show the realization of the O&M process for the individual subsystems according to the optimal policies based on SOM and PM-DQN, respectively. In these figures showing time histories of component-level costs in each subsystem, blue bars indicate maintenance costs cM,i spent on repairs, while red bars, representing shutdown costs cS,i, are not marked on the chart because all components are repaired before shutdown. Under the SOM policy, each agent immediately takes the O&M policy to minimize the loss of QoS in individual subsystems, thereby repairing subsystems immediately even minor damage at the subsystem level as if they were part of a series system as shown in [Fig. 6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0006)(a). In the PM-DQN policy, the agent managing subsystem 3 operates in the same way as in the SOM policy, because subsystem 3 significantly influences the system QoS. In contrast, the other two subsystems connected in parallel are treated even more tolerantly than the SOM, since the two act as a detour to each other and the failure of either subsystem does not directly lead to the loss of system QoS. This difference between these two algorithms is clearly shown in [Fig. 7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0007), which illustrates the annual average flow capacity loss in individual subsystems and the system under all policies. As can be seen from the results of all policies, the QoS loss in subsystem 3 plays a dominant role in the QoS loss of the system due to its series-connected topology in the system.\n\n![Fig 6](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S095183202300426X-gr6.jpg)\n\n1.

Annual average loss of QoS in individual subsystems or system in Example 1 under each policy.\n\n### 4.2. Example 2: the simplified California gas distribution system with 48 gas substations\n\nExample 2 deals with a more realistic lifeline system, the California gas distribution system in [Fig. 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0003). Unlike Example 1, there are two types of components in the system; some components located in the west, close to the Pacific Ocean, are modeled as type II components with a high deterioration rate, while the rest are modeled as Type I. The maximum flow capacity MFsys between two [terminal nodes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/terminal-node \"Learn more about terminal nodes from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") is given as 1.0 when all [substations](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/substations \"Learn more about substations from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") operate in the AGAN state. Through community detection shown in [Fig. 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0004)(a), the size of the action space is shrunk from 248≅2.81×1014 to 25+6×26+27\\=544. After resizing the subsystems as shown in [Fig. 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0004)(b), the largest action space is reduced from 27\\=128 to 26\\=64.\n\nBefore comparing the performance of the proposed algorithm with the baselines, we examine the needs for component reallocation discussed in [Section 3.1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0011). Boxplots in [Fig. 8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0008) show the expected life-cycle costs before and after reallocating the subsystem sizes evenly for learning cycles of PM-DQN. Outliers under the worst performing hyperparameters are excluded for visualization purposes. Comparing the training results up to the third cycle, in which sufficient learning has not been achieved yet, the variance of the learning rate of PM-DQN without reallocation is significantly larger than that with reallocation. This is because the policy search for a relatively large number of state and action spaces has not been conducted effectively and sufficiently in the largest subsystem 2. While their variances become similar after the 4th cycle, the former's estimated life-cycle cost becomes equal to that of the latter only after the 10th cycle is completed. As learning continues, both expected costs keep decreasing, achieving almost the same life-cycle cost. This shows that PM-DQN works well for large systems with components that have different [degradation processes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/degradation-process \"Learn more about degradation processes from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), although the convergence rate becomes lower than before.\n\n![Fig 8](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S095183202300426X-gr8.jpg)\n\n1.

Expected life-cycle costs for learning cycles with and without reallocation in PM-DQN.\n\nThe performances of baselines and MARL-based policies including the PM-DQN without reallocation estimated through 1,000 demonstrations are summarized in [Table 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#tbl0005). The optimal CBM and TBM policies are explored through five iterations as in Example 1. As a result, the threshold state set and repair time interval set are respectively determined, as shown [Appendix C](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0021). As in Example 1, the TBM policy shows inferior results due to the stochastic environment, and the life-cycle cost of the CBM policy, showing excellent performance in Example 1, is higher than those of other MARL-based algorithms. While CBM evaluates the effect of individual components on system QoS at the component level and determines the state thresholds for repair, the system QoS fundamentally depends on the combination of states of various components. This characteristic becomes more prominent as systems get more complex, which is confirmed through the performance change of CBM compared to MARL-based approaches in Example 1 and Example 2. Although the CBM policy ranks with the DCMAC and PM-DQN policies in a simple system in Example 1, it faces the limitations in Example 2.\n\nTable 5. Life-cycle costs and computational time of PM-DQN and four baselines for Example 2.\n\n| Method | Total life-cycle cost | Time (_sec_) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| CBM | 89.95 | 20,126 |\n| TBM | 161.61 | 214,140 |\n| SOM | 88.82 | 103,456 |\n| DCMAC (parallel processing) | 87.13 | 137,211 |\n| PM-DQN (w/o Reallocation) | 86.77 | 97,437 |\n| **PM-DQN (w/ Reallocation)** | **86.60** | **101,934** |\n\nThis also applies to SOM. Although the SOM policy may be an optimal decision at each subsystem level, the result of the optimal PM-DQN policy in [Table 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#tbl0005) shows that the subsystem-level optimal policy does not match that at the system level, where the hyperparameter ω is eventually tuned to 23.90. [Fig. 9](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0009) shows a simplified California gas system consisting of 9 subsystems, and the realizations of the system O&M by SOM and PM-DQN policies are shown in [Fig. 10](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0010)(a) and (b), respectively. To minimize the QoS loss at the subsystem level, SOM manages subsystems 3 and 4 conservatively compared to PM-DQN even though they are connected in parallel. Accordingly, the loss of QoS in individual subsystems is well maintained at a low level in the SOM policy as shown in [Fig. 10](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0010)(a). However, because large maintenance cost is required for the SOM policy, the life-cycle cost under the policy shows inferior results to the PM-DQN and DCMAC policies.\n\n![Fig 9](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S095183202300426X-gr9.jpg)\n\n1.

Life-cycle O&M results during an epoch in Example 2: component-level costs (i.e., cM,i and cS,i) and loss of QoS in each subsystem (i.e., cf,jSOM\\=fSD·Lj) under (a) the SOM policy, and (b) the PM-DQN policy.\n\nIn contrast, the PM-DQN policy considers the QoS loss of subsystems and systems simultaneously. Subsystems except for subsystems 3 and 4 have no separate bypass. This means that, even if agents maintain subsystems 3 and 4 loosely, other subsystems should be managed conservatively as shown in [Fig. 10](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0010)(b). In this way, system simplification based on community detection identifies the system topology and provides the basis for convergence of each agent's local optimal policy to the global optimal policy. The PM-DQN policy takes advantage of this to manage the system, thereby showing the best expected life-cycle costs at the system level.\n\n[Fig. 11](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0011) shows the training history of DCMAC with and without parallel processing. In parallel processing, the optimal learning rates for actor and critical networks are explored in the range of \\[10−7,10−3\\] and \\[10−5,10−3\\] respectively, gradually converging to the combination of learning rates with the lowest life-cycle costs. The best learning rates among the explored ones are utilized for single-processing DCMAC as well as the parallelized DCMAC. For the first cycle (i.e., the first 5,000 episodes), there is not much difference between the two results. However, the gap widens considerably right after the synchronization of parallel-trained policies. The difference never diminishes until the end of training, and the superior performance resulting from parallelization is comparable to PM-DQN; comparing them in terms of performance and computation time, PM-DQN is slightly better, but the difference is not significant considering the structural difference between the two models. This implies that the proposed parallel processing framework with periodic synchronization has a dominant effect on performance improvement and it can be transferred to other DRL methods.\n\n![Fig 11](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S095183202300426X-gr11.jpg)\n\n1.

Training history of original and parallelized DCMAC with 95% confidence intervals in Example 2.\n\n## 5\\. Summary and conclusions\n\nThis paper proposed an optimal decision-making framework based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), termed parallelized multi-agent deep Q-network (PM-DQN), for efficient risk-informed operation and management (O&M) scheduling of large civil lifeline systems. Existing methods dealt with these system-level O&M scheduling problems by limiting the size of the systems or approximating them as component-level [subproblems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/subproblem \"Learn more about subproblems from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") due to the exponentially growing state and action spaces. However, these types of computational complexity reduction may incur a significant loss of accuracy. Moreover, even if the action space is relaxed, it is still necessary to find the best policy by exploring all policy combinations. To find the optimal policy, the multi-agent credit allocation problem should be solved by inferring the contributions to the centralized cost function. Unstable feedback depending on the policy selection of other agents hinders decentralized policy learning. In contrast, the proposed algorithm overcame this challenge by introducing a divide-and-conquer strategy with community detection and parallel processing. Since network clustering is based on the system topology, the subsystems identified by the Girvan-Newman [clustering algorithm](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/clustering-algorithm \"Learn more about clustering algorithm from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") can achieve an appropriate balance between accuracy loss and computational complexity reduction. The strength of the proposed algorithm is further enhanced by reducing the policy exploration time and tuning the optimal hyperparameters in combination with parallel operation. Multiple processing units derive an optimal policy set under hyperparameter tuning and periodic synchronization with the best one. The accuracy and efficiency of PM-DQN were demonstrated on a multi-state general system with 15 components and the California gas distribution system with 48 components. In each numerical example, the optimal PM-DQN policies outperformed baseline alternatives including conventional O&M policies and other MARL-based policies in terms of computational time as well as the expected life-cycle costs. In particular, the California gas distribution system represented as a general system of subsystems through community detection shows the system's topological characteristics prominently, indicating the reason for the good performance of PM-DQN in subsystem level decision-making.\n\nThe proposed PM-DQN trains multiple agents simultaneously by defining factorization cost functions based on the causal relationship between the flow capacity losses in the whole system and subsystems. Because the hyperparameter tuning and the entire process of policy exploration are performed independently across multiple processing units, the proposed algorithm has high scalability for the ever-evolving scale of processing units. In addition, the algorithm features flexible handling of the problem, such as adjusting the number of processing units according to the complexity of problems and the computing power. The parallelization remains scalable and flexible even when other MARL algorithms are used. However, there are some other obstacles arising from the limitations of MDPs that hinder the modeling and application of real lifeline network system O&M; it is difficult to consider the time required for actions in the discrete-time domain, and there is a time gap between state change and maintenance actions. In addition, if more diverse action options, such as minor repairs or reinforcements, are given, policy learning at the subsystem level may suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Nevertheless, for efficient MARL and parallel processing, the proposed framework of deploying agents and periodically synchronizing multiple processors can be applied to various other DRL methods. As shown in Example 2, vanilla DRLs specialized for parallel processing are expected to improve exploration and training stability, thereby enabling simple but powerful end-to-end learning without additional clustering or cost splitting.\n\nFurthermore, we can extend the proposed method to a [partially observable MDP](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/partially-observable-markov-decision-process \"Learn more about partially observable MDP from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") (POMDP) environment by considering monitoring errors in grasping system states. The computational cost is higher than that in MDP environment because belief function is continuously updated, and monitoring action is additionally considered. However, we can broaden the scalability of the existing algorithms by taking advantage of parallel processing and system simplification based on network clustering. Further research is underway to model state changes in the continuous-time domain and actions that take different times using Semi-Markov decision processes [\\[23\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0023). In addition, the development of such a framework is expected to achieve the scalability to cope with unexpected events (e.g., earthquakes, typhoons).\n\n## CRediT authorship contribution statement\n\n**Dongkyu Lee:** Visualization, Validation, Software, Methodology, Conceptualization, Investigation, Writing – original draft. **Junho Song:** Resources, Project administration, Funding acquisition, Conceptualization, Supervision, Writing – review & editing.\n","throughput":{"Bytes":218575},"full_id":"throughput/parse_document_to_pair/---\ncreated: 2023-09-21T15:56:43 (UTC +01:00)\ntags: []\nsource: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673\nauthor: M.A. Jacobs, M.

Therefore, a promising application combining PSS and equipment portrait is to establish a more refined portrait model to improve the accuracy and applicability of operation and maintenance (OM) schemes for industrial products. However, studies in the above field are facing many challenges. For example, the research on equipment portrait in the industrial field is still in its infancy. PSS and equipment portrait are studied separately, and the overall solution that integrates PSS and equipment portrait for complex products OM service is almost vacant. A personalised OM approach for complex products (POMA-CP) is proposed to address these challenges. First, a framework of POMA-CP is developed to show how the processes of refined OM can be implemented. Then, a solution of POMA-CP based on the framework is designed. A multi-level case library, dynamic equipment portrait model, and case-pushing mechanism are established and developed. Active pushing of the best similar cases and automatic generation of service schemes are realised. Finally, an application scenario for a high-speed electric multiple units (EMU) bogie is presented to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Higher accuracy and applicability for service schemes are achieved, resulting in the efficient reusing of OM knowledge, proactive implementation of refined maintenance, and reducing maintenance cost and resource consumption.\n\n-   [Previous](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S073658452200165X)\n-   [Next](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001715)\n\n##

Introduction\n\nProduct complexity has been described in the literature as having many dimensions (including the number of components, the number of modules, the diversity of relations between components, and the commonality of products in an assortment) [\\[1\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0001), [\\[2\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0002), [\\[3\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0003), while complex products are usually defined as a durable product with a lifespan of over 10–30 years [\\[4\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0004). In addition, complex products also have the characteristics of complex structure, long research and development (R&D) cycle, strict quality control and high maintenance service requirements \\[[5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0005),[6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0006)\\]. Therefore, complex products’ [operation and maintenance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/operation-and-maintenance \"Learn more about operation and maintenance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") (OM) service can provide huge potential for establishing a balance amongst users, [original equipment manufacturers](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/original-equipment-manufacturer \"Learn more about original equipment manufacturers from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") (OEMs), and natural environment \\[[7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0007),[8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0008)\\]. Complex products’ personalised OM service demands are emerging with the ever-increasing usage of customised products. As a result, many OEMs are making efforts to employ the product-service system (PSS) to provide high value-added service for their users to improve customer satisfaction and promote the implementation of cleaner production (CP) and circular economy (CE) strategies \\[[\\[9\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0009), [\\[10\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0010), [\\[11\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib69)\\].\n\nWith the advancement of smart technologies in the [Industry 4.0](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/industry-4-0 \"Learn more about Industry 4.0 from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") paradigm, the research on integrating PSS with OM services has attracted many scholars’ attention. As pointed out by Zheng et al. \\[[12](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0011),[13](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0012)\\], the combination of PSS and smart technologies can enable innovative applications of OM service for complex products. Exner et al. \\[[14](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0013)\\] analysed how OM services can be connected to the PSS to enhance machine availability while [reducing energy consumption](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/reducing-energy-consumption \"Learn more about reducing energy consumption from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and the cost of maintenance procedures. D. Mourtzis et al. \\[[15](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0014)\\] studied an unscheduled OM service of manufacturing equipment following the PSS. A maintenance planning system was proposed to facilitate [knowledge sharing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/knowledge-sharing \"Learn more about knowledge sharing from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") amongst OEMs, users and service providers within the PSS \\[[16](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0015)\\]. Recent research achievements, such as PSS-based maintenance grouping strategy \\[[17](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0016)\\], process-based OM service [knowledge management](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/knowledge-management \"Learn more about knowledge management from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") mechanism \\[[18](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0017)\\], sustainable service-orientated equipment maintenance \\[[19](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0018)\\], active [preventive maintenance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/preventive-maintenance \"Learn more about preventive maintenance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") with lifecycle big data \\[[6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0006),[8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0008),[20](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0019)\\], and lease-orientated opportunistic maintenance \\[[21](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0020)\\], etc., have provided significant references for industrial practitioners to develop and apply the PSS-based product OM pattern.\n\nHowever, the PSS-based OM services face new issues while the increase in product complexity and industrial automation. For instance, how to effectively integrate the scattered and multi-stage stakeholders and [lifecycle data](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/lifecycle-data \"Learn more about lifecycle data from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), rationally apply the historical OM service knowledge, and facilitate the OEMs to carry out personalised and refined OM services. Fortunately, equipment portrait, as an emerging technology derived from user portrait, can accurately describe personalised user needs \\[[22](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0021)\\] and construct fine-grained portrait models to analyse complex products’ operational status and fault symptoms \\[[23](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0022)\\]. Besides, equipment portrait has achieved initial success in software product development and maintenance \\[[24](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0023)\\], machine tools intelligent maintenance \\[[25](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0024)\\], and water supply infrastructures OM service \\[[26](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0025)\\]. Therefore, the equipment portrait shows great potential for addressing the above issues and realising personalised and refined product OM services.\n\nDespite the progress achieved by the researchers in the abovementioned work, new questions are arising from applying equipment portrait to personalised OM service of complex products in the [big data environment](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/big-data-environment \"Learn more about big data environment from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and Industry 4.0 paradigm:\n\nFirst, the core of equipment portrait is extracting the set of feature labels. However, the lifecycle data of complex products is usually characterized by high volume, high velocity and high variety \\[[27](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0026)\\]. As a result, it is difficult for industrial practitioners to effectively define different feature labels of products according to specific application scenarios when they are not clear on how to use the lifecycle data best \\[[28](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0027)\\]. That is, the prescriptive and structured processes for the establishment of equipment portrait models for complex products to make OM service decisions were seldom investigated. As pointed out by Liu et al. \\[[29](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0028)\\], a promising application of equipment portrait in the industrial field is the use of its model to conduct a targeted analysis of the performance of products and systems. Therefore, the authors highlight an important research question (RQ1): how should an equipment portrait-based framework for OM service delivery and execution process of industrial complex products be structured to exploit the values of portrait technology in product OM service activities?\n\nSecond, current research on product OM mostly combines either equipment portrait and maintenance service \\[[30](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0029)\\] or aligns PSS mode with maintenance policy planning \\[[17](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0016),[31](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0030)\\]. As pointed out by Grover et al. \\[[32](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0031)\\], the interaction of accessible product data and efficient [data analytics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/data-analytics \"Learn more about data analytics from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and appropriate business model can obtain more insights to improve maintenance services. However, virtually no literature provides knowledge of exploiting equipment portrait and PSS to bring out value from lifecycle data, and to carry out more precisely and prescriptive maintenance measures \\[[33](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0032),[34](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0033)\\]. This resulted in the industrial practitioners being unable to comprehensively and accurately assess the operational conditions of complex products, which makes it difficult to fulfil the current requirements of personalised and refined product OM services. This limitation stimulated another research question (RQ2): what methods can be applied to effectively integrate portrait technologies and PSS mode to extract knowledge from PSS delivery process data and to define feature labels, so as to support an equipment portrait-based decision for the OM service delivery and execution process?\n\nThis paper proposed a personalised OM approach for complex products (POMA-CP) based on equipment portrait within the PSS mode to answer both of the above questions. The proposed method can contribute to constructing a more accurate equipment portrait model based on the comprehensive, meticulous and personalised requirement information of complex products OM services. It is important to emphasise that, with the wide application of smart technologies in Industry 4.0, the large amount of data related to the product's operational status and the whole lifecycle captured in the PSS delivery processes are valuable assets for extracting the above information. Therefore, the combined PSS and equipment portrait application is not simply a study of innovative product management but provides a new paradigm for realising the preventive and refined as well as personalised OM service for complex products. The proposed approach has strong flexibility and adaptability toward complex products’ OM services in big data and Industry 4.0 environments. As a result, two such technologies incorporate numerous potentials for industrial practitioners to implement personalised and refined OM services.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organised as follows. [Section 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0002) reviews the relevant literature. [Section 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0006) and [Section 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0007) outline the overall framework and solution of POMA-CP based on equipment portrait, respectively. In [Section 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0020), an application scenario is presented to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. The conclusions, limitations, and future works are summarised in [Section 6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0025).\n\n## 2\\. Literature review\n\nThis section briefly reviews related studies in two aspects: (1) user portrait and equipment portrait, and (2) PSS-based product [OM](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/operation-and-maintenance \"Learn more about OM from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") service. The application of PSS mode creates the capability for [OEMs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/original-equipment-manufacturer \"Learn more about OEMs from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") to better control and manage their products, which in turn makes it possible to access and acquire the whole [lifecycle data](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/lifecycle-data \"Learn more about lifecycle data from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of PSS delivery processes \\[[6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0006),[35](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0034)\\]. These data can be analysed to provide sufficient feature labels set for constructing of more accurate and refined equipment portrait. Meanwhile, a promising application of equipment portrait is the use of its feature labels for specific scenarios to improve the efficiency and accuracy of OM services decision-making. Therefore, the PSS mode and portrait technology (user portrait or equipment portrait) are two major pillars to exploit the potential of lifecycle data and to carry out the personalised and refined product OM services. Knowledge gaps identified from the review are summarised at the end of [Section 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0002).\n\n### 2.1. User portrait and equipment portrait\n\nThe most cited definition of user portrait was introduced by Cooper \\[[36](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0035)\\], who believed that user portrait was a virtual representation of real users. Meanwhile, the user portrait can be divided into different types according to different behaviours and motivations. As a result, the common features of different users can be extracted and described by some labels. The user portrait is based on the real user. However, it is not specific to a certain person or user. Meanwhile, user portrait emphasises the research on a certain type of object with common characteristics and standards. Therefore, for user portraits, a virtual object usually corresponds to one or a class of physical entities.\n\nWith the advent of big data, the connotation of user portraits has changed. Gauch and Speretta believed that user portrait is mainly composed of weighted keywords and semantic web \\[[37](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0036)\\]. Teixeira et al. \\[[38](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0037)\\] pointed out that a user portrait is an information set of personal data extracted from massive user data and a model to describe a user's needs and preferences. The main challenges of user portrait applications in adaptive [recommender systems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/recommender-systems \"Learn more about recommender systems from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and intelligent e-commerce systems were investigated by Schiaffino and Amandi \\[[39](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0038)\\]. To improve the accuracy and performance of user portraits, an ontology-based portrait learning method was proposed \\[[40](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0039)\\]. The author found that the user portrait information can be enriched by integrating data mining and semantics. In the [big data environment](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/big-data-environment \"Learn more about big data environment from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), user portrait and its privacy challenges were discussed by Hasan et al. \\[[41](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0040)\\]. The authors investigated a concrete example of constructing a portrait model with [big data techniques](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/big-data-technique \"Learn more about big data techniques from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and the approach to preserving user privacy. A user behaviour portrait was developed based on the mobile phone [trajectory data](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/trajectory-data \"Learn more about trajectory data from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") to judge [airport](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/airfield \"Learn more about airport from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") congestion and provide suggestions for airport users \\[[42](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0041)\\]. A user portrait-based [transfer learning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/transfer-learning \"Learn more about transfer learning from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") mechanism was designed to conduct knowledge transfer amongst the cross-domain recommender systems \\[[43](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0042)\\]. The results showed that the accuracy of the proposed method substantially outperforms other methods. To solve the sparse data problem of e-commerce recommender systems, a diffusion-based algorithm was proposed to generate the user portrait and perform personalised and high-quality recommendations \\[[44](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0043)\\].

PSS-based product OM service\n\nAs reported by Si et al. \\[[46](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0045)\\] and Palmarini et al. \\[[47](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0046)\\], their reliability can be improved by analysing the operational data of complex products and executing relevant maintenance services. Due to the advantages of PSS for reducing product defects and improving maintenance task accuracy \\[[6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0006),[8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0008),[48](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0047)\\], the research on combining OM service and PSS is attracting more scholars’ interest.\n\nMarchi et al. \\[[49](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0048)\\] investigated the advantages of PSS-based maintenance activities for enhancing competitiveness and sustainability in the steel industry. The authors also analysed the influence of PSS design decisions on product reliability and OM activities. In order to increase productivity and perform accurate OM service, a PSS-based maintenance method supported by [augmented reality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/augmented-reality \"Learn more about augmented reality from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") was developed \\[[31](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0030)\\]. The authors found that the proposed method can be used to calculate the remaining operating time between failures and identify the available windows of the products to perform remote maintenance. After this, an assistance application of PSS-based [preventive maintenance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/preventive-maintenance \"Learn more about preventive maintenance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") for manufacturing equipment was introduced to improve the internal communication of Business to Business (B2B) and reduce time and cost during the maintenance service procedures \\[[15](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0014)\\]. An adaptive and PSS-based maintenance grouping strategy for complex multi-component systems was proposed to implement [predictive maintenance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/predictive-maintenance \"Learn more about predictive maintenance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") planning \\[[50](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0049)\\]. The author claimed that the proposed strategy could provide long-term dynamic planning for PSS providers. Within the [Internet of Things](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/internet-of-things \"Learn more about Internet of Things from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") (IoT) environment, how industrial practitioners can integrate real-time data and predictive analytics algorithms to manage maintenance policies dynamically and to realise PSS mode were explored by March and Scudder \\[[51](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0050)\\]. In the use-orientated PSS, a heuristic replacement policy and inventory control approach for condition-based product maintenance was formulated to improve the service provider's profitability \\[[52](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0051)\\]. A single case of engineering services for the maintenance and modification operations in offshore petroleum [logistics operations](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/logistics-operation \"Learn more about logistics operations from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") was studied to reveal the dynamics of building network capabilities in a consistent network structure, and to investigate the problem of manage economisation in service provision and use processes \\[[53](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0052)\\]. Based on the PSS mode, an opportunistic maintenance policy was developed to handle the challenges of multi-procedure capacity for serial-parallel leased systems and maximise the leasing profits \\[[21](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0020),[54](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0053)\\]. The authors suggest that the proposed policy can schedule maintenance intervals and can the maintenance decisions dynamically. A [joint](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/joints-structural-components \"Learn more about joint from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") optimisation model of maintenance and spare parts ordering policy was proposed for the use-orientated PSS to address the hardware failures and replacement spare parts problems \\[[55](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0054)\\]. The author demonstrated that the proposed policy could maximise system effectiveness by simultaneously considering the availability of systems, spares and repair engineers. A dual-perspective and data-based decision-making framework followed the PSS mode was developed and tested to manage the maintenance service delivery process of manufacturing companies \\[[56](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0055)\\]. Through a semi-structured interview, the authors found that the proposed framework can be used by manufacturing companies to explore the data generated in maintenance and use phase, and to improve their knowledge of machines and service processes. A framework of IoT enabled circular production and maintenance for automotive parts was outlined to facilitate organisation to pursue the integration of environmentally aware solutions in their production systems \\[[57](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0056)\\].

An overview framework of the POMA-CP based on equipment portrait\n\nThis section outlines a novel approach for personalised product OM service. The objective of the proposed approach is to better integrate the PSS delivery processes with equipment portrait to achieve personalised and refined services for complex products.\n\nThe overall framework of the proposed approach is designed and depicted in [Fig. 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#fig0001). Under this framework, the equipment portrait model can be dynamically changed and updated through the shared data and knowledge amongst different [lifecycle stages](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/lifecycle-stage \"Learn more about lifecycle stages from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of PSS delivery processes. Consequently, personalised, refined and accurate OM service can be achieved. The proposed framework includes four components, namely (1) lifecycle data acquisition and value-added processing, (2) OM knowledge mining and service case management, (3) equipment portrait modelling and OM scheme generation, and (4) application services of personalised OM for complex products.\n\n![Fig 1](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0736584522001673-gr1.jpg)\n\n1.

[Download : Download full-size image](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0736584522001673-gr1.jpg \"Download full-size image\")\n\nFig. 1. The overall framework of the POMA-CP based on equipment portrait.\n\nComponent 1 is responsible for acquiring product lifecycle data by emerging perceptive technology and achieving data value-added by bill of material (BOM) mapping. First, the [IoT](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/internet-of-things \"Learn more about IoT from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") devices and [smart sensors](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/smart-sensors \"Learn more about smart sensors from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") are configured for complex products and their key components at the beginning of life to improve the self-sensing ability of products in the middle of life and the end of life \\[[61](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib70)\\]. For example, the real-time position and operational status data of products can be obtained through the configured GPS and smart sensors in the operation stage. Furthermore, the configured [radio frequency identification](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/radio-frequency-identification \"Learn more about radio frequency identification from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") (RFID) tags and Auto-ID devices can be used to quickly identify the maintenance objects’ information in the maintenance stage. Second, various BOMs can be established based on the data of different lifecycle stages, including engineering BOM, manufacturing BOM, process planning BOM, etc. Similarly, a service BOM of the OM stage can be built to organise the massive OM data and provide value-added data for the OM service decision-making. In this paper, a composite BOM structure (consisting of neutral BOM, instance BOM, maintenance task BOM, and collectively called xBOM) is designed to establish the service BOM. Finally, an xBOM mapping technology can be developed to ensure OM service information's consistency and traceability. Thereby, reliable and holistic data assets can be provided for the personalised and refined product OM services.\n\nGenerally, experience-based maintenance service decisions will lead to lower service efficiency and customer satisfaction. Therefore, it is necessary to mine the OM service knowledge from the historical OM data to provide powerful knowledge support for the personalised OM services by effective [knowledge management](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/knowledge-management \"Learn more about knowledge management from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and reuse (Component 2 in [Fig. 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#fig0001)). First, the information or knowledge of product fault category (e.g., fault position, fault cause, fault occurrence time) should be analysed and mined to establish the fault tree model of complex products. Second, according to the mined fault [category knowledge](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/knowledge-category \"Learn more about category knowledge from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and the case-based reasoning technology, the multi-level OM service case libraries can be constructed to organise the maintenance domain knowledge effectively. For example, an OM service case library can be divided into several sub-case libraries based on the different fault categories. Then, the fault feature keywords can be mapped to a specific fault category. These case libraries can provide valuable knowledge support for the following cases’ active pushing processes while reducing case search time and improving case matching efficiency. Third, by extracting fault symptom keywords and establishing a fault-feature [vector space model](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/vector-space-models \"Learn more about vector space model from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), the characteristics of OM service cases can be expressed to manage the OM service knowledge. As a result, knowledge reuse for personalised OM services can be realised.\n\nTo carry out the personalised and refined OM services of complex products, equipment portraits of different operating conditions and environments should be depicted accurately (Component 3 in [Fig. 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#fig0001)). Generally, the equipment portrait is made up of a label set. Therefore, the label library of OM services should be first constructed. Based on the features and requirements of complex products’ OM services, a three dimensions label library (including behaviour, attribute and fault feature labels) is designed in this paper. Second, considering the dynamics of fault features, an equipment portrait model consisting of multiple feature items (each feature item represents a fault category) and weights can be established using the space vector. Each feature is divided into attribute, behaviour, and fault symptom. As a result, two types of portrait models (i.e., attribute and behaviour feature model and fault symptom feature model) can be constructed. Besides, different model update mechanisms should be developed to update equipment portrait dynamically and periodically. Third, the similarity between source cases (in the established sub-case library) and target cases can be calculated to obtain the best similar cases, which can be further adjusted and optimised to match and generate the final OM scheme for the target products. Meanwhile, the new case should be updated in the original case library.\n\nApplication services of personalised OM are responsible for encapsulating multi-stage OM service business, including intelligent equipment monitoring, personalised OM service scheme, refined OM service management, and component defect improvement (Component 4 in [Fig. 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#fig0001)). For example, by integrating the historical lifecycle data and the real-time operational status data of complex products, portrait models of the key components can be established and updated to monitor their fault features intelligently. By combining the fault features of individual products and the recommended best similar case in the multi-level OM service library, the personalised OM service scheme for different products can be developed. The refined OM service management can realise the control and management of personnel assignment, [task scheduling](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/task-scheduling \"Learn more about task scheduling from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), spare parts supply, etc. According to the fault features and rules reflected by the portrait model in the OM processes, the weaknesses and defects information of current products can be identified. The information can support improving and updating the next generation of product design.\n\nThe logic and relation of the four components in [Fig. 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#fig0001) are described as follows. Component 1 can provide holistic and consistent data for Component 2 through emerging perceptive technology and xBOM mapping technology. As a result, effective knowledge mining, management and reuse in Component 2 can be achieved. Meanwhile, the real-time OM data of Component 1 provides OEMs with the opportunity to update the label library and equipment portrait dynamically and periodically. Therefore, the accuracy and effectiveness of the pushed OM service cases can be enhanced. In addition, the OM case library and knowledge reusing in Component 2 can provide knowledge support for constructing of label library and equipment portrait model in Component 3, which in turn improves the quality and reliability of generated OM scheme. Through Component 2 and Component 3, various application services related to personalised OM in Component 4 can be carried out.\n\n## 4\\. The solution of POMA-CP based on equipment portrait\n\nAccording to the proposed framework, the key technologies (mainly involving Component 2 and Component 3 in [Fig. 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#fig0001)) are introduced in this section, and as a solution of POMA-CP based on equipment portrait. These technologies include case-based reasoning OM knowledge management and reuse, equipment portrait modelling, and active OM service case-pushing.\n\n### 4.1. Case-based reasoning OM knowledge management and reuse\n\n#### 4.1.1. Multi-level OM service case library establishing\n\nDue to the powerful logical relation processing ability of failure mode & effect analysis (FMEA), it is widely used in fault diagnosis (especially for complex products with thousands of components) \\[[62](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0060)\\]. Generally, the FMEA for all complex product components is unnecessary. Therefore, the fault tree models of the critical components are established to conduct the FMEA in practice. A complete fault tree consists of top events, intermediate events and basic events. Due to the limited space, please refer to \\[[63](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0061),[64](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0062)\\] for more information about the main steps and specific methods for executing the FMEA.\n\nThe fault information and knowledge of complex products or critical components can be analysed and extracted based on the FMEA. To improve the efficiency of knowledge managing and reusing, a method for establishing the multi-level OM service case library based on the [FMEA and](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/failure-mode-and-effect-analysis \"Learn more about FMEA and from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") the extracted fault knowledge is developed in this paper (as seen in [Fig. 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#fig0002)).\n\n![Fig 2](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0736584522001673-gr2.jpg)\n\n1.

The structure for multi-level OM service case library of complex products.\n\nFirst, the complex products are divided into _Z_ critical component systems (represented by _[CCS](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/carbon-capture-and-storage \"Learn more about CCS from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\")<sub>z</sub>_) according to their structure and composition. Second, for the _z_th _CCS<sub>z</sub>_, it is divided into _n_ sub-case library (represented by _SCL<sub>z,i</sub>_, ) according to its _n_ fault category (represented by _FC<sub>z,i</sub>_). Third, in the _i_th _SCL<sub>z,i</sub>_, a number of fault symptoms are included. Assume that a total of _m<sub>i</sub>_ fault symptom keywords (represented by _FSK<sub>z,i,j</sub>_, ) are extracted from the fault symptom. Each OM service case (represented by _CASE<sub>z,i,k</sub>_, ) in the _SCL<sub>z,i</sub>_ corresponds to a fault feature space vector that is composed of multiple _FSK_, and contains the essential attribute of product fault and corresponding maintenance scheme (represented by _MS<sub>z,i,k</sub>_). The method of _FSK_ extracting and _CASE_ representation will be described in the following section in detail.\n\n#### 4.1.2. Case-based reasoning OM knowledge reusing\n\nIn this paper, the _CASE_ is regarded as a basic unit of OM knowledge, and each _CASE_ includes some fault information such as fault locations, categories, symptoms and maintenance measures. Therefore, the accuracy of the _CASE_ information expression will greatly affect the efficiency of OM knowledge reuse. Here, the _CASE_ expression refers to a structured description of the information in the historical _CASE_, which is a method of organising the case information according to a specific format. The _CASE_ for complex products can be defined as a four-tuple, as shown below:(1)where, describes the basic information of the _CASE_ for the complex product _CCS_, including case number, fault time, fault location, and fault [symptom description](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/symptom-description \"Learn more about symptom description from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") text, etc. (_S, E_) is the feature set of the _CASE_, where _S_ is the fault symptom feature vector of _CASE_ and represented as , including the _FSK_ () of _CASE_ and its corresponding weight . _E_ is the attribute label information and behaviour label information of _CASE_, including fault location, operating environment, operating parameters, and represented as . Finally, _Q_ is the fault conclusion, including the information on OM service solutions and evaluation results.\n\nThe method for establishing attribute labels and behaviour labels is illustrated in [Section 4.2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0013). The following content of this section will introduce the extraction method of _FSK_ and the [construction processes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/construction-process \"Learn more about construction processes from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of the fault symptom feature vector of _CASE_.\n\n##### 4.1.2.1. Fault symptom keywords extracting\n\nTo quantitatively express the fault symptom feature vector of the _CASE_ text, the text segmentation operation should be performed on the fault record text to obtain the _FSK_. As the best word segmentation module of Python, the _Jieba_ algorithm is widely used in Chinese text segmentation due to its high accuracy and supporting customised dictionaries and multiple modes \\[[65](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0063)\\].\n\nHowever, for a specific complex industrial product, the existing text segmentation tool is difficult to deal with the professional terms effectively. Therefore, it is necessary to supplement and customise the professional dictionary of _CASE_ before performing the text segmentation operation and then carry out the following operations:\n\n-   1)\n    \n    Based on the constructed professional dictionary of _CASE_, the _Jieba_ tokeniser is used to carry out the text segmentation operation, and the forward maximum [matching algorithm](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/matching-algorithm \"Learn more about matching algorithm from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") is adopted to capture the string as long as possible.\n    \n-   2)\n    \n    Based on the text segmentation operation of _CASE_, the fault feature words set will be obtained by setting a stop word table and eliminating the function words and prepositions in fault record sentences.\n    \n-   3)\n    \n    Extract the feature words used to express the OM service domain knowledge of complex products to construct the _FSK_ lexicon. Then, the Chi-square test is used to judge the correlation between fault categories and words in the _FSK_ lexicon. Finally, the words that have a high correlation with product OM service are extracted as the _FSK_. The calculation process of correlation is described in detail as follows:\n    \n\nFor a specific _CCS<sub>z</sub>_, supposing it contains _n FC<sub>z,i</sub>_, and the _CCS<sub>z</sub>_ has _N CASE_. Specifically, for a fault feature word _T_, regarding whether it contains _T_ and whether it belongs to _FC<sub>z,i</sub>_ as the judging conditions, and four values A, B, C and D are obtained (as shown in [Table 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0002)).\n\nTable 2. The relationships between categories and attributes.\n\n| Feature selection | Belong to _FC<sub>z,i</sub>_ | Not belong to _FC<sub>z,i</sub>_ | Event name |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Contain _T_ | A | B | _A_ + _B_ |\n| Not contain _T_ | C | D | C + D |\n| Total | A + C | _B_ + D | _A_ + B + C + D |\n\nCalculating the theoretical value _E<sub>A</sub>_ and difference value _D<sub>A</sub>_ of A by the following formula:(2)(3)(4)\n\nThe method for calculating the theoretical value and difference value for B, C and D is similar to A. The specific methods are not repeated here. Then, the chi-square value between fault feature word _T_ and _FC<sub>z,i</sub>_ is calculated by using the original hypothesis that _T_ is not correlated with _FC<sub>z,i</sub>_:(5)\n\nAt the same time, the chi-square value of the fault feature word _T_ relative to the whole _CASE_ library of the _CCS<sub>z</sub>_ is calculated:(6)where, represents the probability that the case in the _CASE_ library of the _CCS<sub>z</sub>_ belongs to the _FC<sub>z,i</sub>_. The greater the value , the larger the error for the original hypothesis. That is, the fault feature word _T_ has a strong correlation with the _FC<sub>z,i</sub>_. Subsequently, calculating the chi-square values of all fault feature words according to the abovementioned method and arranging them from large to small. Meanwhile, a certain number of fault feature words are screened according to a preset threshold value. As a result, the _FSK_ lexicon can be established.\n\n##### 4.1.2.2. Fault symptom feature vector constructing of the _case_\n\nThe _i_th _SCL<sub>z,i</sub>_ corresponds to the _i_th _FC<sub>z,i</sub>_ of the _z_th _CCS<sub>z</sub>_ (as seen in [Fig. 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#fig0002)), and the _k_th _CASE<sub>z,i,k</sub>_ is analysed. Therefore, _R_ fault symptom keywords (i.e., ) contained in the case text are first extracted, and then the [vector space model](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/vector-space-models \"Learn more about vector space model from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of the fault symptom feature of the _CASE_ is established. Here, the case text is regarded as a vector space composed of a group of [orthogonal vectors](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/orthogonal-vector \"Learn more about orthogonal vectors from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). The fault symptom feature vector of the _CASE_ is expressed as , () is the _FSK_, is the weight of each _FSK_.\n\nThe weight can be calculated by the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) algorithm. The TF-IDF is a feature weight algorithm based on term frequency, which is used to evaluate the importance of a feature word to a particular text in a file set \\[[66](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0064),[67](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0065)\\]. TF is the word frequency of feature words in a particular text, and IDF measures the importance of a feature word. Therefore, the weight of is expressed as a function of and . The is calculated by:(7)where, refers to the times of occurred in a certain _CASE_, and is the total number of occurred in the _CASE_.\n\nMeanwhile, the is calculated by:(8)where, is the total number of all _CASE_ in the _FC<sub>z,i</sub>_, is the number of _CASE_ that contain in the _FC<sub>z,i</sub>_.\n\nThe weight of is calculated by:(9)\n\nThe greater the value (i.e., TF-IDF value) of , the more important it is to the _CASE_. Based on the obtained weight of each , the feature selection weight of (namely the weight threshold of TF-IDF) is defined and determined by the following equation:(10)\n\nIf , the of the _CASE_ is retained; if , the of the _CASE_ is excluded. Finally, the retained is used to construct the fault symptom feature vector of the _CASE_.\n\nFurthermore, the weight can be further normalised by the following formula:(11)\n\n### 4.2. Equipment portrait modelling and OM service case active pushing\n\n#### 4.2.1. Label library constructing and equipment portrait modelling\n\nA proper label library is significant to establishing an equipment portrait model. Generally, a label is a tuple containing product attributes and values. It can be described as _Label_\\=<_Name: W_\\>, where _name_ indicates the label name, and _W_ is the weight. The type and value of weight are determined by label attributes, including numerical type, interval [data type](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/data-type \"Learn more about data type from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), text type, etc.).\n\n##### 4.2.1.1. Label library designing for complex products\n\nIn view of the characteristics and OM service requirements of complex industrial products, a three dimensions label library (including attribute label, behaviour label and fault symptom label) is designed in this paper. They are briefly introduced as follows:\n\nThe attribute label represents the inherent static attributes of complex products, such as equipment type, manufacturer, rated power, and other information. This information will not change dynamically over time and can be obtained directly from the product database.\n\nThe behaviour label consists of the operational status information of complex products, which may change dynamically with time (e.g., operational time, average failure rate, maintenance times, operational environment). Such labels can be obtained by statistical or logical calculation.\n\nThe fault symptom label is similar to the _FSK_ in [Section 4.1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0008). Such labels may change dynamically over time and can be obtained by analysing and mining complex products’ operational performance record text. For example, the [operational load](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/operational-load \"Learn more about operational load from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") is too high, abnormal wear in the bearing shell, bearing temperature is too high, etc.\n\n##### 4.2.1.2. Portrait modelling for complex products\n\nBased on the label library, an equipment portrait model of complex products can be developed. For the _CCS_ of complex products, the equipment portrait model _M<sub>u</sub>_ can be defined as follows:(12)where (_F<sub>i</sub>, E<sub>i</sub>_) represents the fault category feature vector that corresponds to _FC<sub>i</sub>_ in the _CCS_, each (_F<sub>i</sub>, E<sub>i</sub>_) is associated with a weight _ω<sub>i</sub>_. The weight _ω<sub>i</sub>_ refers to the proportion of the occurred times of _F<sub>i</sub>_ amongst all fault categories in a fixed time window. In particular, only the feature vectors whose weights are greater than the threshold _ω<sub>threshold</sub>_ can appear in the equipment portrait model _M<sub>u</sub>_.\n\nThe fault category feature vector (_F<sub>i</sub>, E<sub>i</sub>_) mainly contains:\n\n-   (1)\n    \n    **Fault symptom feature model _F<sub>i</sub>_**. Considering the name of labels in the fault symptom feature model are dynamical changing, it can be described as:(13)\n    \n\nwhere () is the th fault symptom label; is the weight, which indicates the importance of the fault feature; is the time when the label is added to _F<sub>i</sub>_; is the time when the label is last updated in _F<sub>i</sub>_. The weight consists of the local weight and global weight of the label, which is calculated by the following formula:(14)\n\n-   1)\n    \n    Local weight of the label\n    \n\nThe value of the local weight is determined by the occurred times of fault symptom label in the . To avoid , the local label is redefined as:(15)where indicates the occurred times of label in in the historical OM records.\n\n-   1)\n    \n    Global weight of the label\n    \n\nThe local weight cannot be used to measure the accuracy of different labels in identifying various fault categories. Therefore, the concept of [conditional entropy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/conditional-entropy \"Learn more about conditional entropy from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") is introduced to define the global weight of the label \\[[68](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0066)\\], which is represented by . First, the fault categories set is seen as the information sources which conform to some probability distribution, and the _FC_ and the label are regarded as two [random variables](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/random-variable-xi \"Learn more about random variables from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). Second, the importance of a label to a certain _FC_ is determined by the gain between the information entropy of the fault categories set and the conditional entropy of the label \\[[69](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0067)\\]. Finally, the conditional entropy of the _FC,_ which corresponds to the label, can be calculated by the following formula:(16)where indicates the probability of when the label appears, when the label is determined, . As a result, the above equation can be expressed as:(17)where indicates the number of _FC_ in the fault categories set; indicates the times of in ; indicates the times of in the whole fault categories set.\n\n-   (1)\n    \n    **Attribute and behaviour feature model _E<sub>i</sub>_**. Considering the name of labels for attribute and behaviour feature model is fixed, the occurred times of label do not need to be considered when establishing the . Therefore, the attribute and behaviour feature model can be described as:(18)\n    \n\nwhere () represents the attribute label or behaviour label. It contains detailed information related to the _FC_ and other essential information (such as manufacturer, component number, operational status, [service duration](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/service-duration \"Learn more about service duration from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), operational load, etc.); is the label content.\n\nWhen a label of an abnormal event appears in the OM service abnormal event log text set, it is important to map it to the corresponding FC accurately, and then the personalised and refined OM services can be realised. To achieve this objective, the [conditional probability](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/conditional-probability \"Learn more about conditional probability from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of the abnormal event label belonging to each _FC_ should be first calculated. Then the _FC_ of the abnormal event label is divided into the categories with the highest conditional probability value. The main steps for calculating the conditional probability of the abnormal event label are as follows:\n\n-   1)\n    \n    Given an abnormal event log text as a sample set, where the _FC_ is known. Calculating the conditional probability of each abnormal event label in each _FC_:(19)\n    \n-   2)\n    \n    Assuming that the abnormal event labels of the sample set are independent of each other, the probability of an abnormal event log text with a label belonging to the FCi is calculated by the following formula:(20)P(FCi|attr)\\=P(attr|FCi)P(FCi)P(attr)\n    \n-   3)\n    \n    For all fault categories, the P(attr) can be regarded as a constant, so P(attr) can be removed and P(attr|FCi)P(FCi) can be calculated separately, namely:(21)P(attr|FCi)P(FCi)\\=P(attr1|FCi),P(attr2|FCi),...,P(attrm|FCi)P(FCi)\\=P(FCi)∏j\\=1mP(attrj|FCi)\n    \n-   4)\n    \n    Therefore, the _FC_ of the abnormal event log text is determined as:(22)FC\\=argmaxP(FCi)∏j\\=1mP(attrj|FCi)\n    \n\nThe above method regards the weight of all labels as equal. However, various labels play different roles in different [text classification](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/text-classification \"Learn more about text classification from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") application scenarios. To improve the text classification performance, the TF-IDF algorithm in [Section 4.1.2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0010) is used to calculate the weight of abnormal event text labels for the _CASE_ and carry out the mapping between abnormal event labels and fault categories.\n\nAssume that the abnormal event log text of a _CASE_ has a label attr\\={attr1,attr2,...,attrm}, the term frequency of attrj is calculated by TF(attrj)\\=nj∑i\\=1mni, nj refers to the occurred times of attrj in the abnormal event log text, and ∑i\\=1mni is the total number of the attrj occurred in the _CASE_. Meanwhile, the [inverse document frequency](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/inverse-document-frequency \"Learn more about inverse document frequency from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of attrj in the abnormal event relative to the FCi is calculated by IDF(attrj,FCi)\\=logNiNi,j+1, Ni is the number of cases in the _CASE_ library of the FCi, and Ni,j is the number of cases in the _CASE_ library where FCi contains label attrj.\n\nFor the abnormal event log text that contains the label attr\\={attr1,attr2,...,attrm}, the weight ωi,j of label attrj relative to the FCi is calculated by:(23)ωi,j\\=TF(attrj)\\*IDF(attrj,FCi)\n\nFinally, the _FC_ of the abnormal event log text is identified as:(24)FC\\=argmaxP(FCi)∏j\\=1mP(attrj|FCi)ωi,j\n\n#### 4.2.2. OM service case active pushing and scheme decision-making\n\nDue to the dynamic changing of behaviour label and fault symptom label in the equipment portrait model, real-time monitoring and tracing of the CCS that frequently occurred faults can be achieved. As a result, the reuse of historical OM knowledge can be realised. Based on the dynamic monitoring of _CCS_ and efficient reusing of OM knowledge, an active pushing mechanism for the _CASE_ is proposed. The processes of active pushing of the _CASE_ for complex products are shown in [Fig. 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#fig0003). For each feature item of the equipment portrait model, the similarity between the sub-case library and the target case should be calculated to obtain the best similar cases. Then, the best similar cases are adjusted according to the target case's requirements and the OM service scheme is generated applicable to the target product. The local similarity and global similarity of _CASE_ are involved.\n\n![Fig 3](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0736584522001673-gr3.jpg)\n\n1.

The active pushing processes of complex products’ OM service cases.\n\n##### 4.2.2.1. The local similarity calculation of OM service case\n\nAssuming that the fault category feature vector of _FC<sub>i</sub>_ in equipment portrait model _M<sub>u</sub>_ is (_F<sub>i</sub>, E<sub>i</sub>_). Let CASEFCi\\={CASEFCi,1,CASEFCi,2,....} represents the _SCL_ of _FC<sub>i</sub>_, and CASEFCi,k represents the kth _CASE_ of the _SCL_. Usually, the types of label values for the equipment portrait model mainly include symbols, numerical values, interval numbers and texts. Therefore, to achieve the active pushing of _CASE_ and the refined OM services, it is necessary to calculate the local similarity for different label values. Usually, the label value types for model _E<sub>i</sub>_ are mainly symbols, numerical values and interval numbers, while the label value types for model _F<sub>i</sub>_ are mainly texts.\n\nFor a label attrj, let LS(Eij,CASEFCi,kj) represent the local similarity between model Ei and CASEFCi,k, WEj and WFCj represents the values of Ei and CASEFCi,k, respectively. Meanwhile, let LS(Fij,CASEFCi,kj)represent the local similarity between model Fi and CASEFCi,k. The calculation methods of local similarity for different label value types are introduced as follows.\n\n-   (1)\n    \n    Symbol\n    \n\nSymbol labels usually have a fixed value set, enumerating all possible values for these labels. And each value is represented by an explicit symbol. For example, the value of the label ‘_CNC machine_’ can be _JV_<sub>1</sub>, _JV_<sub>2</sub>, _JV_<sub>3</sub>, _JV_<sub>5</sub>, etc. Then, the local similarity of the symbol label is calculated by:(25)LS(Eij,CASEFCi,kj)\\={1WEj\\=WFCj0WEj≠WFCj\n\n-   (1)\n    \n    Numerical value\n    \n\nLet max(CASEFCij) and min(CASEFCij) represent the maximum value and minimum value of label attrj in the _SCL_ that correspond to the FCi, respectively. Therefore, the local similarity of the numerical value label is calculated by:(26)LS(Eij,CASEFCi,kj)\\=1−|WEj−WFCj|max(CASEFCij)−min(CASEFCij)\n\n-   (1)\n    \n    Interval number\n    \n\nThe upper and lower bounds of the interval are represented by Lj and Hj respectively, and label attrj∈\\[Lj,Hj\\]. Therefore, the local similarity of the interval number label is calculated by:(27)LS(Eij,CASEFCi,kj)\\=1−|WEj−LjHj−Lj−WFCj−LjHj−Lj|\n\n-   (1)\n    \n    Text\n    \n\nText similarity is mainly reflected in the fault symptom feature model Fi. That is, if the label is an evaluation label, the label name is a text type, and the value is the weight of each label. Given Fi and a case S\\={(attr1:η1),...,(attrm:ηm)} in the CASEFCi,k. Only the common labels of Fi and S are considered. Thereby, Fi\\={(attr1F:η1F),...,(attrnumFF:ηnumFF)}, S\\={(attr1FC:η1FC),...,(attrnumFFC:ηnumFFC)}. Let Fij is the jth common label attrjF in Fi, and its similarity is LS(Fij,CASEFCi,kj)\\=ηjF·ηjFC. As a result, the local similarity of text label is calculated by:(28)LS(Fi,CASEFCi,k)\\=∑j\\=1numFηjF·ηjFC\n\n##### 4.2.2.2. The global similarity calculation of OM service case\n\nLocal similarity can only be used to measure the relationship between Fi (or Ei) of equipment portrait model _M<sub>u</sub>_ and the _CASE_. Therefore, the local similarity calculation for different label values has some limitations. For instance, it is difficult to achieve accurate pushing of the _CASE_ and thus difficult to carry out refined OM service. To overcome these limitations, it is necessary to calculate further the global similarity between the (_F<sub>i</sub>, E<sub>i</sub>_) of equipment portrait model _M<sub>u</sub>_ and _CASE_.\n\nConsidering the dynamic changing of the label in _F<sub>i</sub>_ and the missing attribute of the label in _E<sub>i</sub>_, the structure similarity should be involved while calculating the global similarity between (_F<sub>i</sub>, E<sub>i</sub>_) and CASEFCi,k. The global similarity GS(Fi,CASEFCi,k) of the fault symptom feature model _F<sub>i</sub>_ and CASEFCi,k is obtained by summing up the local similarity of the common fault symptom labels of _F<sub>i</sub>_ and CASEFCi,k, and then multiplying the structural similarity:(29)GS(Fi,CASEFCi,k)\\=JS(Fi,CASEFCi,k)·LS(Fi,CASEFCi,k)\\=NFi∩CASEFCi,kNFi∪CASEFCi,k·∑j\\=1numFηjF·ηjFCwhere, JS(Fi,CASEFCi,k) is the structural similarity of _F<sub>i</sub>_ and CASEFCi,k; NFi∩CASEFCi,k is the number of attributes for the [intersection set](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/intersection-set \"Learn more about intersection set from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of _F<sub>i</sub>_ and CASEFCi,k; NFi∪CASEFCi,k is the number of attributes for the union set of _F<sub>i</sub>_ and CASEFCi,k; numF is the number of common fault symptom labels.\n\nIn the same way, the global similarity GS(Ei,CASEFCi,k) between the attribute and behaviour feature model _E<sub>i</sub>_ and the CASEFCi,k is obtained by summing up the local similarity of the common attribute and behaviour labels of _E<sub>i</sub>_ and CASEFCi,k, and then multiplying the structural similarity:(30)GS(Ei,CASEFCi,k)\\=JS(Ei,CASEFCi,k)·∑j\\=1numELS(Eij,CASEFCi,kj)ρj∑j\\=1numEρj\\=NEi∩CASEFCi,kNEi∪CASEFCi,k·∑j\\=1numELS(Eij,CASEFCi,kj)ρj∑j\\=1numEρjwhere, JS(Ei,CASEFCi,k) is the structural similarity of _E<sub>i</sub>_ and CASEFCi,k; NEi∩CASEFCi,k is the number of attributes for the intersection set of _E<sub>i</sub>_ and CASEFCi,k; NEi∪CASEFCi,k is the number of attributes for the union set of _E<sub>i</sub>_ and CASEFCi,k; numE is the number of common attribute and behaviour labels; ρj(j\\=1,2,..,num) is the weight of common label, which is determined by expert experience.\n\nFinally, the global similarity between the (_F<sub>i</sub>, E<sub>i</sub>_) and the CASEFCi,k is calculated by the following formula:(31)GS((Fi,Ei),CASEFCi,k)\\=GS(Fi,CASEFCi,k)·ρF+GS(Ei,CASEFCi,k)·ρEρF+ρEwhere, ρF is the weight of _F<sub>i</sub>_, and ρE is the weight of _E<sub>i</sub>_.\n\nAfter calculating the global similarity between each (_F<sub>i</sub>, E<sub>i</sub>_) of equipment portrait model _M<sub>u</sub>_ and _CASE_ of the _SCL_, the best similar cases that correspond to these fault category feature vectors can be obtained by ranking the similarity from large to small. The higher the similarity value ranked, the more valuable the _CASE_ is for future OM service solutions. Then, a set composed of these best similar cases is formed. These best similar cases will further correspond to a set that consists of some OM service solutions. According to the real-time operational status of complex products, the solutions can be dynamically adjusted (such as deleting, adding, replacing, modifying, etc.). As a result, the final OM service scheme can be generated and actively pushed to the OM service scene. Therefore, auxiliary decision support can be provided for complex products’ personalised and refined OM services. In addition, for the _CASE_ with low similarity, it does not mean that it has no value for OM service decision-making. For example, experienced maintenance personnel can help judge and verify the usefulness of the _CASE_. As a result, the modified _CASE_ according to the abovementioned operations can be updated and added to the _SCL_ to enrich the case library, and to provide more similar cases for OM service decision-making.\n\n## 5\\. A study of the application scenario\n\nThe proposed approach is tested by an application scenario of an industrial partner company. The main objectives of the application scenario study are to test how equipment portrait can be used in the OM service of complex products and what improvements are made by the combined application of equipment portrait and PSS in personalised OM service.\n\nIn this section, an overview of the application scenario is provided. Then, the established methods of the application scenario's multi-level OM service case library are introduced. Third, the active pushing processes of OM service cases for bogie wheelsets of high-speed electric multiple units (EMUs) are elaborated. Finally, the advantages of the proposed POMA-CP based on equipment portrait within the PSS mode are analysed and discussed.\n\n### 5.1. Overview of the application scenario\n\nThe partner company is a rail transit equipment manufacturer in China which focuses on the R&D, manufacturing, service and maintenance support of high-end railway equipment. The company has manufactured over 10,000 trains in varieties. These trains include high-speed EMUs, intercity EMUs, and urban rail vehicles used by more than 18 railway companies across China. Because the company's trains are mainly used in the passenger transport area, it is of [utmost importance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/utmost-importance \"Learn more about utmost importance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") for the company to prevent faults and ensure safety and reliability. In recent years, the company has developed and manufactured a series of new high-speed EMUs with a top speed of 350 km/h and 400 km/h.\n\nBogie is one of the important components to realise the running task of a high-speed EMU, which has a lifespan of over 20–30 years. It is responsible for guidance, [vibration reduction](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/vibration-reduction \"Learn more about vibration reduction from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), traction, braking and other tasks of the EMUs. The maintenance of the bogie and its key components in a timely and accurate manner directly determines the operational performance and safety of the EMU \\[[70](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0068)\\]. Therefore, it has high quality and maintenance service requirements. In addition, the bogie also has the characteristics of a complex structure. For example, the bogie generally consists of a wheelset, axle box, [bogie frame](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/bogie-frame \"Learn more about bogie frame from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), mechanical drive unit, foundation brake rigging, primary suspension, secondary suspension, etc. Each component is made up of thousands of parts. Meanwhile, all the abovementioned tasks of the EMU need to be realised by the complex movement relations between different components of the bogie. Therefore, the EMU bogie is a typical complex product. [Fig. 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#fig0004) is a schematic diagram of the H38L (a virtual name used in this paper) high-speed EMU bogie manufactured by the partner company.\n\n![Fig 4](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0736584522001673-gr4.jpg)\n\n1.

The schematic diagram of the H38L high-speed EMU bogie.\n\nIn the past, since local railway companies operated the EMUs in different geographical areas, the operational status data of EMU and their critical components in diverse conditions could not be acquired accurately and completely. As a result, the efficiency of OM service schemes for EMU based on incomplete and inaccurate operational status data was lower, which has directly affected the safety and service life of EMU. Meanwhile, the knowledge that affects fault analysis and service decision-making is difficult to reuse due to the unreasonable organisation and management of historical OM knowledge. This has made active pushing of OM service cases extremely difficult to realise.\n\nTherefore, it is important to determine how to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of OM service cases pushing and schemes decision-making for EMU to improve safety and reliability, which was the main challenge the partner company faced for a long period. Recently, with the rapid advancement of portrait technology and the wide application of PSS mode, the company sought a new way to achieve the potential of applying the lifecycle data and historical OM knowledge of EMUs for fault analysis and OM scheme decision-making and to transform its manufacturing mode from the product-driven pattern to the system-integration and the service-driven one. Therefore, they tested the novel approach according to [Section 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0006). The proposed approach was tested and followed the combination of quantitative and qualitative methods based on case analysis and semi-structured interviews.\n\n### 5.2. Establishing of bogie multi-level OM service case library\n\nThe failure reporting analysis and corrective action system (FRACAS) is the main tool developed by the partner company and its service providers to manage the OM data of EMUs within the service-driven manufacturing mode. In the FRACAS, the fault record data of the operation process and maintenance site for the geographically scattered EMU are included, which is analysed in this paper to excavate the fault information of bogie. The fault information of the EMU bogie is automatically triggered by the activation of an alarm function that setting in the FRACAS.\n\nThe FRACAS can record multiple fields related to EMU fault information (e.g., date of fault, EMU number, fault description, fault cause, fault effect, troubleshooting measure, responsible department, etc.). Based on this information, the working principle and operating environment of the EMU are further aligned to construct the fault system of the EMU bogie (as shown in [Table 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0003)).\n\nTable 3. The fault system of EMU bogie.\n\n| **Critical component system fault** | **Sub-system fault** | **Parts fault** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| The EMU bogie | Wheelset | Wheel tread fault |\n| Wheel flange wearing |\n| Axle fault |\n| Brake disc fault |\n| Axle box and locating device | Axle box damage |\n| Axle box bearing failure |\n| Axle end-cover fault |\n| Axial positioning device fault |\n| Bogie frame | Frame weld opening, frame crack |\n| Frame deformation |\n| Mechanical drive unit | Gearbox fault |\n| Shaft coupling fault |\n| Traction motor fault |\n| Foundation brake unit | Brake pad fault |\n| Balance slide bar failure |\n| Bellow break |\n| Brake disc crack |\n| Brake cylinder fault |\n| Primary suspension | Axle box spring failure |\n| Rubber mat falling off |\n| Vertical damper fault |\n| Secondary suspension | Air spring fault |\n| Levelling valve fault |\n| Differential pressure valve fault |\n| Anti-roll bar fault |\n| Lateral damper fault |\n\nBased on the EMU bogie fault system in [Table 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0003), the bogie's structure and failure mode are analysed by applying [FMEA](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/failure-mode-analysis \"Learn more about FMEA from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") to construct the fault tree model of the EMU bogie (as shown in [Fig. 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#fig0005)). The symbol and definition of each event in the fault tree model are shown in [Table 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0004).\n\n![Fig 5](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0736584522001673-gr5.jpg)\n\n1.

Moreover, the text processing method in [Section 4.1.2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0010) is adopted to extract the _FSK_ and the possible fault causes of each sub-case library. Finally, a multi-level OM service case library is obtained. Detailed information is given in [Table 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0010) of the Appendix. Based on the bogie's multi-level OM service case library, the method in [Section 4.1.2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0010) is used to define and express the OM service case. As a result, the bogie OM service case structure can be represented as a table (as shown in [Table 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0005)).\n\nTable 5.

In particular, the detailed operation instructions of the suggested solution text can be provided in the maintenance operation structured files. For example, the information in maintenance operation structured files mainly includes maintenance task name, operation number, personnel and labour-hour, task description, spare parts, operation instruction text, etc. According to this information, maintenance instructions can be provided for field personnel.\n\n[Table 6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0006) shows an example of the original record of an EMU bogie OM service case. Based on the original case record, fault categories can be analysed and judged by the method of fault symptom keywords extracted introduced in [Section 4.1.2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0010). Finally, the OM service cases are expressed and managed by the structure represented in [Table 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0005), as shown in [Table 7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0007). This mode can be further used to provide knowledge support for the active pushing of personalised OM service schemes for bogie and to promote the achievement of knowledge reuse.\n\nTable 6.

Active pushing of OM service cases for bogie wheelset\n\nTaking the wheelset of the bogie for the H38L high-speed EMU as an example, the feasibility and effectiveness of the active pushing method of OM service cases are verified in this section. Given the equipment portrait model of the bogie is _M<sub>u</sub>_\\= {(_F_<sub>1</sub>, _E_<sub>1</sub>): _ω_<sub>1</sub>, (_F_<sub>2</sub>, _E_<sub>2</sub>): _ω_<sub>2</sub>, …, (_F<sub>n</sub>, E<sub>n</sub>_): _ω<sub>n</sub>_}, and assumed that (_F_<sub>1</sub>, _E_<sub>1</sub>) represents the fault category feature vector of the wheelset. When a certain fault of the wheelset occurred, the FRACAS will extract the portrait model of the wheelset and the sub-case library that corresponds to this fault type. Then, the similarity calculation instruction will be further triggered in the FRACAS to calculate the similarity between the fault category feature vector and OM service case in the sub-case library to get the best similarity cases. The best similar case corresponds to an OM service solution of the fault type for the bogie wheelset. Therefore, the suggested solution text should be extracted from the previously established OM service case library based on the occurred fault type.\n\nIn this application scenario, the fault feature vector of the wheelset in the target case is expressed as _F_<sub>1</sub>\\= {wheel tread scrape: 0.5, wheel indentation depth transfinite: 0.3, wheel wear: 0.2}. Furthermore, the attribute and behaviour feature vector are expressed as _E_<sub>1</sub>\\= {TT: H38L, TN: G372, TMN: 3736, CN: 02, mileage: 160,782, EAT: 27, TC: hills, RF or SF: yes, FC: wheelset fault, FP: wheel tread}. [Table 8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0008) shows the cases related to the fault case library of the EMU bogie wheelset. Meanwhile, [Table 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0011) of the Appendix shows the value types of the feature items of the EMU bogie fault case library.\n\nTable 8. Cases related to the fault case library of bogie wheelset.\n\n| **Feature items** | **Case 1** | **Case 2** | **Case 3** | **Case 4** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **F** | FSFV | {wheel rim crack: 0.7, wear: 0.3} | {wear: 0.3, sparking: 0.35, brake shoe deformation: 0.25} | {wheel tread scrape: 0.4, abnormal noise: 0.35, wear: 0.25} | {wheel tread scrape: 0.15, wheel tread peeling: 0.85} |\n| **E** | TT | H380L | H40F | H38L | H30C |\n| TN | G372 | G506 | G434 | G650 |\n| TMN | 3651 | 3013 | 3782 | 3023 |\n| CN | 02 | 06 | 03 | 07 |\n| Mi/km | 113,500 | 57,805 | 191,421 | 132,560 |\n| EAT/ °C | 12 | 20 | 30 | 26 |\n| TC | Hills | Plain | Plain | Hills |\n| RF or SF | No | No | Yes | Yes |\n| FC | Wheelset fault | Wheelset fault | Wheelset fault | Wheelset fault |\n| FP | Wheel rim | Wheel tread | Wheel tread | Wheel tread |\n| **Suggested solution** | This fault is caused by local material fatigue. If the wheel rim crack is not more than 80 mm, the train can directly run to the destination after inspecting and affirming by manage department. If the crack exceeds 80 mm, the carriage should be disengaged from the train immediately to ensure the safety of the whole EMU. | This fault is caused by the poor material of the brake pad. For example, the adhesive, filler or auxiliary material does not conform to regulation. The rail transit equipment company should strictly screen their suppliers and control the quality of parts. | The wheel tread scrape and wear are caused by the failure of the electronic antiskid device due to the excessive braking force of the train. The wheel lathe needs to be replaced and trimmed to the circular. Then repair the electronic antiskid device to work properly and avoid the wheel scrape. The fixed frequency abnormal noise is caused by local depression of the wheel tread due to the too-soft material of the wheelset and foreign object impact. This problem needs to be fed back to the wheelset supplier to adjust the material. | This fault is related to the material's low yield and tensile strength. The wheelset needs to be replaced. Then the wheel lathe needs to be trimmed to improve the smelting quality and to reduce the metal wear caused by tread peeling. |\n\nBy using the similarity calculation method in [Section 4.2.2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0017), four cases in [Table 8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0008) are matched. Meanwhile, the weight value of each feature item is {0.5, 0.05, 0.03, 0.01, 0.01, 0.1, 0.04, 0.03, 0.03, 0.1, 0.1}. That is, the weight ρF of _F_<sub>1</sub> is 0.5, and the weight ρE of _E_<sub>1</sub> is 0.5. Meanwhile, set the mileage range to \\[0, 1,800,000\\], the lower limit of operation environment temperature is −30 °C, and the upper limit is 40 °C. Finally, the case matching results ranked from high to low by global similarity is shown in [Table 9](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0009).\n\nTable 9. The OM case matching results.\n\n| The case number | The global similarity of case |\n| --- | --- |\n| Case 3 | 0.8165 |\n| Case 4 | 0.7158 |\n| Case 1 | 0.6971 |\n| Case 2 | 0.6372 |\n\nAs seen in [Table 9](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0009), Case 3 has the greatest global similarity. Therefore, Case 3 can be suggested and considered the best similar case for the target product, and its solution has the most reference value. And the solution of Case 3 can be pushed to field personnel, and then the OM service for the wheelset can be carried out following the generated maintenance operation structured files. However, the fault contained in the solution of case 3 is different from the target product. For example, there is no abnormal noise problem for the target product. Thereby, the personalised OM service solution for the target product does not contain measures for [noise cancellation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/noise-cancellation \"Learn more about noise cancellation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). That is, the suggested solution should be adjusted according to the actual OM situation through artificial intervention. As a result, the adjusted OM service scheme is replacing the wheel lathe and trimming it to the circular, repairing the electronic antiskid device to work normally, and avoiding the wheel scrape.\n\nThe above-mentioned processes illustrated that the way for the personnel to confirm or dismiss the usefulness of the suggested solution is involved and considered in the application scenario study. According to the method and process described in [Section 4.2.2.2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0019), experienced maintenance personnel will intervene in the judgement and [verification processes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/verification-process \"Learn more about verification processes from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of the usefulness of the OM service case. As a result, the edited and adjusted OM service case will be dynamically updated to the sub-case library. Therefore, if the suggested solution is not the right one, the FRACAS will generate and recommend the new solution through the OM service structured document platform based on personnel confirming and editing the solution content. The interviews confirmed that the partner company adopts the human-based manner to improve operational decision-making in maintenance service delivery processes based on the actual OM service situation. Feedback to improve and adjust the system-based solution proposal for the introduction of new ones according to the actual maintenance task is necessary.\n\n### 5.4. Analysis and discussions\n\nThe study of the application scenario provides strong evidence that the proposed approach is valid and feasible, which indicates that it has the potential to be applied in the industry field for product OM services. Compared with other research \\[[25](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0024),[26](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0025),[30](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0029)\\], the major difference is the novel combination of PSS and portrait technology with the possibility of acquiring more comprehensive lifecycle data and the advantage of describing personalised user requirements and providing refined product services.\n\nThe proposed novel POMA-CP based on equipment portrait within the PSS mode makes it possible to access the product data of different [lifecycle stages](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/lifecycle-stage \"Learn more about lifecycle stages from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and trace the business data of different stakeholders. For example, the product data at the beginning of life (design and manufacturing stages), middle of life (operation, service and maintenance stages) and end of life (remanufacturing, recycling, reuse), and the business data scattered in OEMs, component suppliers, maintenance service providers, product operators, etc. These data create effective means to enable inter-connect user needs, personalised OM and sustainable competitive advantage. For example, the abovementioned data can be analysed to construct the fine-grained label library and accurate portrait model to manage better and maintain complex products while improving different stakeholders’ business processes and decisions. As a result, the complex products can be run in a better state, thereby enhancing customer satisfaction and promoting user buyback and [user experience](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/user-experience \"Learn more about user experience from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). This would be a potential competitive advantage for OEMs and service providers.\n\nThe proposed approach, along with the multi-source data of different lifecycle stages and stakeholders, allows the service providers to find more hidden fault features and match more precise OM service schemes in a shorter time. This will contribute service providers to reducing maintenance costs and resource consumption, OEMs optimising product design and [manufacturing process](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/production-process \"Learn more about manufacturing process from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), and product users reducing safety risks caused by a sudden failure. Therefore, the PSS mode, rich data, and personalised OM approach are three significant pillars for exploring the potential of the equipment portrait for complex products. These three elements provide insights to service providers and OEMs to develop and implement [sustainable business models](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/sustainable-business-model \"Learn more about sustainable business models from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") in line with corporate social responsibility.\n\nAccording to the semi-structured interviews with the managers of the partner company, in the past, even though mainly operational data of the critical components for EMU bogie were collected and analysed, the deviation between the maintenance decision and task execution is often produced. This is mainly caused by the dynamic changing of bogie operational status, fuzzy relationship, and inconsistent data transmission amongst different lifecycle stages and stakeholders. By applying the novel OM approach with multi-source lifecycle data and dynamic attribute and behaviour label library, more fault features and knowledge were found to conduct targeted analysis on bogie's operational status and performance. Therefore, personalised, refined and active OM services can be carried out to ensure the safety and reliability of EMU. This can move the service providers from planned [corrective maintenance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/corrective-maintenance \"Learn more about corrective maintenance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") to proactive and condition-based OM service planning [\\[6\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0006), reducing the service providers’ [OM costs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/operation-and-maintenance-cost \"Learn more about OM costs from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and ensuring the customers’ safety. The managers of the partner company also emphasised that the schemes of the bogie OM service case for frequent faults can provide new ideas and insights for research and development of the next generation of the EMU bogie. Moreover, other potential benefits of the novel approach, such as the personalised and refined OM service for [product families](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/product-family \"Learn more about product families from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), can be realised because of the rich portrait models.\n\n## 6\\. Conclusions\n\nMany manufacturing enterprises of complex products have transformed their businesses towards PSS modes and have integrated user portraits with relevant OM services, which helps accelerate the transition of service mode to refined, differentiated, [personalised services](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/personalized-service \"Learn more about personalised services from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). As a result, the concept of equipment portrait has received increasing attention in complex products’ OM service studies. Meanwhile, the opportunities for OEMs to accurately describe personalised user demands by comprehensive collecting the data of PSS delivery processes for complex products are continuously increasing. However, with the [permeation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/permeation \"Learn more about permeation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and application of portrait technology in industrial and complex products’ OM service fields, OEMs are facing many challenges. For example, how should a prescriptive procedure for equipment portrait-based OM service delivery and execution processes of industrial complex products be structured, and how to effectively organise and reuse the knowledge extracted from the PSS delivery process data to support equipment portrait-based OM service decision-making?\n\nIn order to address the challenges, in this paper, a novel framework and solution of POMA-CP based on equipment portrait within the PSS mode was proposed. First, the proposed POMA-CP framework contributes to the research related to the investigation of a prescriptive and structured process for the implementation of the equipment portrait-based OM service decision-making. The framework answers RQ1 by guiding the industrial practitioners in exploiting data generated during the whole PSS delivery lifecycle to improve and optimise the OM service delivery and execution processes (e.g., personalised and refined OM service), then addressing one of the knowledge gaps identified from existing literature (as stated in paragraph 2 of [Section 2.3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0005)). Second, another knowledge gap identified from the literature review existed in the lack of approaches proposed for exploiting the integrated application of equipment portrait and PSS (as stated in paragraph 3 of [Section 2.3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0005)). The solution of POMA-CP contributes to addressing this gap and answers RQ2 by introducing a set of methods in each component aimed at organizing and managing the knowledge excavated from PSS delivery processes data to establish a precise portrait model, and support the industrial practitioners in personalised and refined OM service decision-making.\n\nThe limitations of this paper are summarised as follows. First, in the application scenario, only one case record (see [Table 6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0006)) and one bogie (see [Table 8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0008)) for a specific EMU was used to test the effectiveness of the active pushing mechanism of the OM service solution. To strengthen the applicability and robustness of the proposed approach, different components for this application scenario and different types of EMU bogies as well as different operational conditions (or case records) should be considered and tested comprehensively. Second, when organising and expressing the OM service case of EMU bogie, only ten mainly features (see [Table 7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0007)) that reflect bogie fault features were selected to construct the attribute and behaviour feature vector. In order to improve the efficiency and accuracy of case matching, more features should be selected and considered to enrich the case library's information and provide more fine-grained information or knowledge for personalised and refined OM services. Third, the system-based and human-based manner are combined together in the application scenario study to generate the best similarity cases and to suggest the final OM service solutions. However, the validation test comparing human-based and system-based solution proposals and the time required to evaluate the proposed solution were not performed in this work.\n\nFuture research will focus on the following three aspects. First, the labels used to establish the equipment portrait model will dynamically change along with the different operational conditions of complex products. Therefore, a periodic updating mechanism (as stated in [Section 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0006)) of the equipment portrait model should be investigated to implement more refined OM services. Second, with the ever-increasing accumulation of equipment operational data and OM service abnormal event log text, more advanced algorithms should be considered to improve the accuracy of fault symptom keywords extracting and fault cause identification (as stated in [Section 4.2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0013)). Third, more abundant similarity calculation methods for different types of label values (as stated in [Section 4.2.2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0017)) should be developed and involved to maximise historical OM service knowledge's [reusability](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/reusability \"Learn more about reusability from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and enhance the precision of OM service case-pushing and scheme decision-making.\n\n## CRediT authorship contribution statement\n\n**Shan Ren:** Writing – original draft, Methodology, Software. **Lichun Shi:** Methodology, Software. **Yang Liu:** Supervision, Validation, Writing – review & editing. **Weihua Cai:** [Data curation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/data-curation \"Learn more about Data curation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). **Yingfeng Zhang:** Supervision, Validation.\n\n## Declaration of Competing Interest\n\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. [52005408](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#gs0001) and [U2001201](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#gs0001)) and the Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi ([2021GY-069](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#gs0002)).\n\n## Appendix\n\nTable A.1.

T…\n\n---\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nComponents in civil infrastructure systems, such as bridges, pipes, and electric wires, deteriorate over the life cycle of the systems due to corrosion of materials and other environmental factors. Component failures caused by the degradation may trigger a system-level failure event, e.g., [power outage](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/power-outage \"Learn more about power outage from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), service disruption, loss of network connectivity, or degenerate the systems’ the quality of service (QoS) like usability and [serviceability](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/serviceability \"Learn more about serviceability from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") [\\[1\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0001). Since civil infrastructure systems, especially lifeline systems including power, water, or gas transmission systems, have a great impact on [modern societies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/modern-society \"Learn more about modern societies from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), not only can each failure cause huge socio-economic losses, but system-level malfunctions multiply the damage exponentially. To quantify the risk uncertainty of these system elements, numerous studies on risk modeling based on stochastic processes have been conducted \\[[2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0002),[3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0003)\\]. Based on these modeled risk, decision-makers should establish apposite risk-informed operation and maintenance (O&M) policies considering the inevitable changes in system-level QoS and the consequences of system failure \\[[2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0002),[4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0004)\\].\n\nVarious O&M strategies have been developed for structures in civil lifeline systems. For example, time-based maintenance (TBM) undertakes maintenance based on the predetermined repair time intervals, i.e., without monitoring or criteria evaluation \\[[5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0005),[6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0006)\\]. On the other hand, condition-based maintenance (CBM) aims to perform [preventive maintenance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/preventive-maintenance \"Learn more about preventive maintenance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") based on the information acquired or interpreted in various forms \\[[6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0006),[7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0007),[8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0008),[9](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0009)\\]. Although it is straightforward to scale and apply these O&M schemes to multiple components, the introduction of exogenous variables such as the cost of system failure events hampers their direct extensions to system-level decision-making processes. This is because component-level [optimality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/optimality \"Learn more about optimality from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") does not ensure the optimal decisions at the system level [\\[10\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0010). Therefore, stakeholders and decision-makers of civil lifeline systems should be able to establish an O&M policy based on the system-level performance rather than on the conditions of individual components during the life cycle.\n\nFor O&M policy planning for a system consisting of components subject to uncertain failures, classical theories of system reliability \\[[11](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0011),[12](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0012),[13](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0013)\\] often introduce a Markovian model to handle the characteristics of the components and the system. If the same system control policy is applied over the life cycle, stationary conditions are achieved after a warm-up period. Thus, the system availability can be expressed as a closed-form expression under the assumption that components have constant mean failure rates [\\[13\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0013). However, such an O&M policy based on the steady-state assumption is not flexible enough to cope with many plausible exceptions in practice, e.g., an old road facing its service life.\n\nIn efforts to obtain optimal O&M decisions without special assumptions such as steady-state conditions in a finite time horizon, a [Markov decision process](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/markov-decision-process \"Learn more about Markov decision process from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") (MDP) has been considered as a preferred framework to formulate the stochastic processes of [structural deterioration](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/structural-deterioration \"Learn more about structural deterioration from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and the risk-informed O&M optimization. Because of the capability to quantify the expected cost or value of various maintenance actions in each state through [dynamic programming](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/dynamic-programming \"Learn more about dynamic programming from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), MDPs have been applied to establish the O&M policies for multi-state systems \\[[14](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0014),[15](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0015)\\] as well as component-level policies [\\[16\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0016) for civil infrastructures. Although MDPs have a fundamental limit in direct applications to large systems due to the curse of dimensionality, i.e., the state and action spaces increase exponentially with the number of the components, researchers have proposed relaxing constraints or seeking approximate solutions \\[[17](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0017),[18](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0018)\\].\n\nIn particular, to overcome the challenges, recent studies have applied many deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithms \\[[19](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0019),[20](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0020),[21](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0021),[22](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0022)\\] to maintenance optimization problems in civil infrastructure systems \\[[23](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0023),[24](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0024),[25](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0025)\\]. More specifically, Yang et al. [\\[26\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0026) utilized a deep Q-learning (DQN) framework for the optimal CBM planning of a multi-state system, and the framework has been further refined with the introduction of double DQN (DDQN) \\[[27](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0027),[28](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0028),[29](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0029)\\]. Moreover, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) \\[[30](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0030),[31](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0031),[32](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0032),[33](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0033)\\], in which multiple agents learn policies to achieve the minimum costs using DRL, has been considered to improve the scalability of DRL applications for optimizing the maintenance of civil systems. For example, Andriotis and Papakonstantinou \\[[10](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0010),[34](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0034)\\] have developed centralized or decentralized MARL-based algorithms, respectively, in terms of sharing or not sharing parameters related to each agent's policy for large civil systems. Zhou et al. [\\[35\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0035) also proposed MARL-based hierarchical algorithms to optimize the O&M decisions of large-scale multi-component systems. To enhance the performance of MARL, Nguyen et al. [\\[36\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0036) introduced a value decomposition network (VDN) algorithm \\[[32](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0032),[37](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0037)\\], decomposing the centralized Q-value into the sum of decentralized Q-values defined for individual agents, to find the best O&M decisions. However, although these MARL algorithms successfully reduce the computational complexity, model training or hyperparameter tuning still requires considerable time even in the relaxed environment. In the numerical examples where the existing MARL methods are applied, the topologies are quite monotonous, such as series- or parallel-systems, and the number of components is also limited.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a parallelized multi-agent deep Q-network (PM-DQN), a divide-and-conquer algorithm that utilizes clustering-based multi-scale approaches \\[[38](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0038),[39](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0039)\\], for risk-informed decision optimization of multi-state flow systems by combining the system simplification with MARL based on parallel processing. In PM-DQN, the agents observe the states of multiple subsystems identified by clustering, and learn decentralized policies to minimize the factorized cost for subsystems. The algorithm guides the decentralized policies chosen by the agents toward the system-level optimality by repeating the learning process through parallel processing and tuning a key hyperparameter based on the results with less computational cost. As a result, the PM-DQN can efficiently manage large systems that are out of control in existing approaches.\n\nThis paper is organized as follows. [Section 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0002) provides a description of the problem setting and the model assumptions for numerical examples, discusses the system-level sequential decision-making optimization problem, and introduces the DDQN and MARL frameworks. [Section 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0010) proposes the PM-DQN algorithm based on the configuration of subsystems based on community detection and the cost factorization. The efficiency and superior performance of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated by numerical examples in [Section 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0014), followed by a summary and concluding remarks in [Section 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0017).\n\n## 2\\. Background information\n\n### 2.1. Problem statement\n\n#### 2.1.1. Descriptions of system state\n\nIn this study, we consider a multi-state flow system with components. It is assumed that the initial state of each component is intact, i.e., as-good-as-new (AGAN) state. The degradation level of components is identified as one of the following discretized damage states through annual observations: _AGAN, slight damage, moderate damage, extensive damage,_ and _collapse_. We assume that the system state is observed without errors. The [system degradation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/degradation-system \"Learn more about system degradation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") state is given as a vector of component states, where is the state of component at time\n\nAs a performance indicator, the maximum flow capacity between two predetermined terminals is used to quantify the QoS of the system. It is assumed that the flow capacity of all components depends on each state as shown in [Table 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#tbl0001). Once the flow capacities of all components are determined, i.e., the system state is observed, the loss of the system QoS, can be calculated as the difference between the current maximum flow capacity and the maximum flow capacity under the initial system state through the max-flow algorithm \\[[1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0001),[40](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0040),[41](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0041)\\]. Depending on the topology of the system, each component's flow capacity loss due to the deterioration has a different effect on the QoS of the system.\n\nTable 1. Flow capacity of each component for each damage state.\n\n| Damage state | AGAN | Slight | Moderate | Extensive | Collapse |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Flow Capacity | 1.00 | 0.95 | 0.50 | 0.25 | 0 |\n\n#### 2.1.2. Descriptions of maintenance and degradation process\n\nBased on the system state information, the agent chooses one of the two options for O&M action for the component at time i.e., ‘Do Nothing (_DN_)’ and ‘Repair it to AGAN state (_R_).’ System-level action is defined as a vector of the actions taken for individual components. Although the size of the action space seems small at the component level, the number of system-level actions that a decision-maker considers each year is which increases exponentially with the number of components.\n\nWe assume that there is no limit to the number of components that can be repaired per step. When the decision-maker selects _R_ for one component, the state becomes the AGAN state deterministically, otherwise it remains the same or deteriorates with a certain probability called state-transition probability The stochastic [degradation process](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/degradation-process \"Learn more about degradation process from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of individual components is modeled as an independent discrete-time Markov process. That is, the state-transition probability for component depends only on the current state and action due to its [Markov properties](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/markov-property \"Learn more about Markov properties from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). While the state-transition probabilities for _R_ are the same for all components, the state-transition probabilities for _DN_ are modeled in two ways depending on the component types, each shown as matrices in the [Appendix A](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0019). Once the system-level action for all components is determined in system state we can define the system-level state-transition probability based on the state-transition probabilities for all components.\n\n#### 2.1.3. Descriptions of operation and maintenance costs\n\nIn the O&M process of civil lifeline systems, various variables (e.g., maintenance costs, system QoS, component malfunction) must be considered simultaneously at each time step. Because of trade-offs between life-cycle costs and the risk of systems, there is often no single solution that optimizes all these variables simultaneously. It is necessary to find an appropriate compromise among the conflicting goals. In multi-objective optimization, one can explore Pareto-optimal solutions that cannot improve an objective function without degrading other objective functions [\\[42\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0042). However, to make a decision among Pareto-optimal solutions, the subjective preference of decision-makers must intervene inevitably.\n\nOne can handle this issue by transforming multiple objective functions into a single objective function through scalarization, i.e., the weighted sum formulation. In this approach, the optimal solution strongly depends on cost functions (or utility functions) used in the scalarization process. In this paper, the objective function which is the total cost at time is defined as the sum of the multiple objective functions scaled to cost as follows:(1)where is the maintenance cost for the component is the cost due to the shutdown of the component and is the system damage cost caused by the loss of system QoS. In [Eq. (1)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0001), conflicts with the other operation costs; and which depend on the state of components and system, decrease with a conservative O&M decision, while incurred by repairs increases. Therefore, a suitable compromise between these costs is desirable.\n\nIn numerical examples in [Section 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0014), it is assumed that the maintenance cost of 1.0 is imposed when is _R_ regardless of and the shutdown cost of 1.0 is charged when component reached the collapse state. Loss of the system QoS, penalizes the system damage cost by a factor of as(2)where is a function representing the maximum flow capacity between predetermined two terminals under system state and is the initial system state vector, i.e., every component is in AGAN state.\n\nIf the term in [Eq. (1)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0001) is neglected, i.e., the objective function is given as a linear function of the component-level costs, the system-level optimization problem is decomposed into multiple component-level optimization problems. The optimal solutions to the [subproblems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/subproblem \"Learn more about subproblems from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") provide the system-level optimum. In most cases, however, given as a function of component state combinations is of great interest. Therefore, the objective function cannot be decomposed into component-level decentralized costs. In other words, the number of combinable policies to explore for achieving a system-level optimal solution grows exponentially with the system size.\n\n### 2.2. System-level sequential maintenance optimization\n\nIn maintenance optimization problems for civil lifeline system, the agent's goal is to determine a policy as a mapping from the state to the action to minimize the Q-value, defined as the expected total discounted costs to the system's lifespan as(3)where is the discount factor to convert future costs into present values. Just as the component-level [optimality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/optimality \"Learn more about optimality from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") does not guarantee the system-level optimality, a greedy optimal decision at every time step cannot assure optimality over the long run in a finite-time horizon environment. This applies to sequential maintenance optimization problems for civil lifeline system O&M throughout the life cycle. An O&M policy is defined to be better than or equal to another O&M policy if and only if its expected cost is smaller than or equal to that of for all states [\\[43\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0043). That is, the optimal O&M policy leads the Q-value to its minimum.\n\nIn value iteration \\[[43](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0043),[44](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0044)\\], considering this point, the Q-value is updated by continuously choosing the action with the lowest Q-value as(4)\n\nAfter initializing all the Q-value estimates to zero, the values are updated iteratively according to the following Bellman equation:(5)where is the Q-value on state and action estimated at the iteration. The value [iteration algorithm](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/iteration-algorithm \"Learn more about iteration algorithm from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") works well in simple environments but does not apply to environments with large state and action spaces. In particular, evaluating the Q-value of every combinable state-action pair in complex environments is nearly impossible.\n\n### 2.3. Double Deep Q-Network with prioritized experience replay\n\nTo overcome the computational limitation, Watkins and Dayan [\\[22\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0022) proposed to apply a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm called Q-learning. In the Q-learning algorithm, instead of [Eq. (5)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0005), the following equation is used to update Q-values iteratively:(6)where is the learning rate; and is the target value.\n\nThe \\-greedy algorithm is often implemented to expedite the exploration and exploitation process for Q-learning [\\[43\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0043). In detail, after initializing Q-value to zero, an agent selects a random action (i.e., exploration) with probability or the action minimizing Q-value (i.e., exploitation) with probability It is common to start with the value of close to 1 and gradually decrease it as information about the environment accumulates.\n\nIn a powerful deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework developed by Mnih et al. \\[[19](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0019),[20](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0020)\\], a parameterized deep Q-network (DQN) is introduced to approximate the Q-value. Each layer in the DQN outputs a [linear combination](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/linear-combination \"Learn more about linear combination from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of inputs and parameters. The framework introduces [activation functions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/activation-function \"Learn more about activation functions from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") between layers, such as rectified linear unit (ReLU), exponential linear unit (ELU), and scaled ELU (SELU), to describe the complex relationships beyond linearity. However, DQN tends to underestimate the Q-values in stochastic environments due to the ‘min’ operator in calculating the target value Double DQN (DDQN) [\\[27\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0027) performs the action selection and Q-value evaluation separately using two different DQNs (i.e., online and target networks), thereby avoiding the underestimation of the Q-values and stabilizing the learning process. The target value is rewritten as(7)where is the Q-value estimated using the online network with parameters and is the Q-value estimated using the target network with parameters respectively. The parameters are periodically updated to the parameters every steps.\n\nIn addition, one can introduce the experience replay [\\[45\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0045), in which agents store the experiences as tuples in a replay buffer and update the online network parameters based on a batch of uniformly sampled tuples from the replay buffer. The uniformly drawn samples significantly reduce the variance of updates owing to the weakened correlation, thereby suppressing the oscillation or divergence of the parameters during the training process. Combining these techniques, DDQN calculates the loss function and updates the online network parameters to minimize by the [gradient descent](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/gradient-descent \"Learn more about gradient descent from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") as follows:(8)(9)where represents a uniform distribution over the replay buffer and is a batch of the tuples sampled from\n\nAgents can gauge the importance of each experience by the temporal difference error (TD-error), i.e., the difference between the expected Q-values before and after the experience. In prioritized experience replay (PER) \\[[46](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0046)\\], the alternative sampling density of a batch of experience tuples which was uniformly distributed, is given as:(10)where is the TD-error; and is an importance sampling hyperparameter, with corresponding to the existing experience replay. The loss function in [Eq. (8)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0008) can be calculated more efficiently using importance sampling as follows:(11)where denotes the probability mass function of the discrete uniform distribution; and is the likelihood ratio to compensate for the bias caused by introducing the alternative sampling density The initial learning process is highly non-stationary because the online and target networks have not been trained enough. Therefore, even if the estimate is slightly biased, stabilization should be the top priority at the beginning phase of learning, and importance sampling correction may be considered later. To this end, in [Eq. (11)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0011) is replaced by , defined as(12)where is the number of experiences in the replay buffer and is a hyperparameter controlling how much to compensate for the bias. As is gradually annealed toward 1.0, starting from a low value (e.g., typically around 0.4 to 0.6), the bias is completely compensated. When combined, DDQN and PER exert a substantial [synergistic effect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/synergistic-effect \"Learn more about synergistic effect from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), thereby neutralizing a significant portion of the existing limitations of Q-learning algorithms.\n\n### 2.4. Factorization in multi-agent reinforcement learning\n\nIn addition to increasing the efficiency of DRL like DDQN with PER, dividing the original problem into multiple subproblems can be a more effective solution to overcome the curse of dimensionality caused by the exponentially increasing number of states and actions. A divide-and-conquer strategy called a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) deploys multiple agents in each segmented state and action spaces, and the agents learn policies to achieve the minimum costs independently or through cooperation.\n\nIf there are no cost functions that agents jointly contribute, a given environment can be simplified by decomposing it into several smaller independent environments \\[[30](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0030),[47](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0047)\\]. In other words, the optimal decision set in sub-problems yields the same solution as the optimal global decision-making. Then, the size of the action space is shrunk from to where is the number of agents, and is redefined as the number of available actions for the agent. As a result, one can handle environments with large spaces of states and actions based on the large scalability.\n\nHowever, in most of complex environments, cost functions take a combination of various states and actions as input, e.g., [Eq. (1)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0001). This leads to the multi-agent credit allocation problem [\\[33\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0033), in which the contributions of individual agents to the cost function must be accurately inferred. To this end, the problem can be segmented into multiple independent environments by factorizing the centralized cost into the sum of decentralized costs through [neural networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/neural-network \"Learn more about neural networks from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") called value decomposition networks (VDNs) [\\[32\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0032) or user-defined functions. No matter how sophisticated the original cost is segmented, accuracy loss is inevitable during the [factorization process](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/factorization-process \"Learn more about factorization process from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), thereby resulting in a trade-off between accuracy and scalability.\n\n## 3\\. Proposed algorithm: parallelized multi-agent deep Q-network (PM-DQN)\n\nThe MARL method combined with DDQN and PER improves the scalability with minimal loss of accuracy, allowing the MDP framework to be applied to complex environments. However, as the number of components in the system increases, the accuracy loss of the MARL method gradually accumulates, eventually leading to a failure in [optimal policy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/optimal-policy \"Learn more about optimal policy from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") search. To alleviate the scalability issue, in this section, we propose a novel MARL algorithm termed “Parallelized Multi-agent Deep Q-Network” (PM-DQN), which assigns multiple agents to subsystems based on community detection, and makes the agents explore decentralized cost-minimizing policies under various hyperparameter values in multiple processing units. The proposed algorithm consists of three steps differentiated from others as follows: (1) system simplification based on network clustering for effective agent allocation, (2) factorization of centralized costs based on a predefined function, and (3) the hyperparameter tuning with parallel processing. [Fig. 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0002)(a) and (b) respectively illustrate the proposed algorithm's microscopic and macroscopic structures of operations.\n\n![Fig 2](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S095183202300426X-gr2.jpg)\n\n1.

(a) Learning process using DDQN with PER in a processing unit, and (b) overall procedure of Parallelized Multi-agent Deep Q-Network (PM-DQN) algorithm.\n\n### 3.1. Step 1: identification of subsystems based on community detection\n\nIn optimizing MARL-based O&M strategies in large-scale systems, it is necessary to find an appropriate balance between minimizing accuracy loss and efficient reduction of the state and action spaces. To this end, we propose a decomposition of the system into a few subsystems, i.e., communities of components. By grouping deeply related components in terms of functionality or densely connected components into one subsystem, the existing system can be simplified into another system of subsystems. This can also lower computational complexity that may scale exponentially with the number of components, while minimizing loss of information. Various algorithms such as spectral [clustering algorithms](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/clustering-algorithm \"Learn more about clustering algorithms from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") \\[[38](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0038),[48](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0048)\\] and Markov clustering algorithm \\[[49](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0049),[50](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0050)\\] have been proposed for community detection. In this paper, the target system is represented by subsystems instead of the existing components based on the Girvan-Newman algorithm \\[[39](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0039),[51](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0051)\\].\n\nThe Girvan-Newman algorithm sequentially removes edges with the highest edge-betweenness, which means the probability that the shortest paths between all node pairs in the graph go through the edge [\\[52\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0052). As edges with high edge-betweenness are removed, the entire graph representing the system is divided into several isolated clusters, and the process of edge removal ends when all edges are removed. In Girvan-Newman algorithm, the modularity is introduced to stop the process at an appropriate time [\\[51\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0051). The modularity represents the difference between the actual number of intra-cluster edges in the existing graph and the expected number of intra-cluster edges when reconstructing the graph while preserving the degree of each node, and is defined as(13)where is the number of isolated clusters; is the number of edges in the graph; is the number of intra-cluster edges in cluster and is the sum of degrees of the nodes in cluster Modularity is updated whenever an edge is removed, and when it is maximized, one can identify subsystems that are separated from each other.\n\nOnce subsystems in the target system are identified using the Girvan-Newman algorithm, we can assign an agent to learn the O&M strategy of each subsystem. However, there is a problem in utilizing the community detection result for PM-DQN; since all agents must be trained for optimal decision-making for the system-level optimal policy, the convergence of PM-DQN is governed by the slowest learning rate among agents (generally the agent with the largest state and action spaces). If components are concentrated in specific clusters, the learning time of the agents increases exponentially, thereby leading to a decrease in learning efficiency of PM-DQN. Therefore, a procedure for adjusting the subsystems to an even size is necessary. To this end, after initial grouping based on the Girvan-Newman algorithm, some components in the largest subsystem are reallocated to other neighboring subsystems. In this process, the number of edges connecting subsystems should be minimized to prevent loss of calculation accuracy due to system simplification.\n\n[Fig. 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0003) shows a simplified California gas distribution system (modified from [\\[53\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0053)) with 48 gas [substations](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/substations \"Learn more about substations from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of two types and 60 bidirectional pipelines. It is assumed that the pipelines are intact during the lifetime of the system, and only the deterioration of the gas substations, whose states can be periodically identified, is considered. The system can be described by a graph model with 48 nodes and 60 edges. [Table 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#tbl0002) shows how modularity and the number of detected clusters change with edge removal by the Girvan-Newman algorithm. As the edges are removed continuously, the number of clusters increases, but the modularity peaks at 8 clusters. However, the detected clusters consist of five to seven components as shown in [Fig. 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0004)(a), resulting in differences in the action space of the agents. Since the learning rate of the agent managing the largest subsystem is lower than that of the other agents, the benefits of parallel processing in simultaneous training of all agents can be underutilized. To compensate for this limitation, one component is reallocated from the largest subsystem to the neighboring smallest subsystem 3 as shown in [Fig. 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0004)(b), making the number of components within subsystems as uniform as possible. In contrast to the previous subsystems in [Fig. 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0004)(a), all subsystems in [Fig. 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0004)(b) consist of the same number of components, so the learning rate of the agent is expected to be similar. The needs for this procedure are discussed through numerical examples in [Section 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0014) by comparing the learning efficiency with or without the reallocation.\n\n![Fig 3](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S095183202300426X-gr3.jpg)\n\n1.

(a) Subsystems detected by Girvan-Newman algorithm, and (b) subsystems with uniformly reallocated components.\n\n### 3.2. Step 2: factorization of centralized costs\n\nAfter assigning one agent to each subsystem detected in Step 1, multiple agents make O&M decisions by comprehensively considering the state of components within each subsystem. To carry out the decision making independently but efficiently for all subsystems, the total cost should be factorized into individual subsystems based on effective multi-agent credit allocation. For example, the total cost in [Eq. (1)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0001) is divided into two parts: decentralized costs (e.g., and and centralized costs (e.g., Since decentralized costs obviously arise from each component, it makes sense to impose the sum of decentralized costs of the components in a subsystem to the corresponding agent. However, allocating the centralized cost to individual agents requires the introduction of VDN or predefined functions. To this end, PM-DQN finds the subsystems that are presumed to cause the loss of system, and selectively allocates centralized costs to those subsystems based on a predefined function. More specifically, by splitting the centralized cost and summing up the decentralized costs, the total decentralized cost for subsystem is expressed as(14)where is redefined as the action chosen by agent at time is the factorized cost transferred from the centralized cost to subsystem and is the hyperparameter that determines the weight of the factorized cost. The factorized cost is predefined as follows:(15)where is the QoS loss in the subsystem; and is a subset of which is the state vector of components belonging to the subsystem. While is calculated based on the maximum flow capacity between two predetermined terminals, is defined as the difference between the total inflow and outflow of the subsystem. The structure of [Eq. (15)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0015) is similar to that of [Eq. (2)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0002) before factorization, but individual agents infer the causality between QoS losses of system and their subsystems using the min operator.\n\nUsing [Eqs. (6)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0006), [(7)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0007), [(14)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0014), and [(15)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0015), one can calculate individual Q-values for each agent In this paper, we utilize the DDQN combined with PER (introduced in [Section 2.3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0008)) for more efficient and stable Q-learning. More specifically, the online network with parameters and the target network with parameters for take the system state vector and the current time step as inputs, and respectively output the Q-values and according to each action in the form of vectors. Then, the optimal action based on the estimated is converted into an \\-dimensional one-hot encoding vector, which is multiplied with the vector form of to update the online Q-value. Unlike these online parameters that are updated every step, the target network parameters are periodically updated to the online parameters every steps. It should be noted that, unlike VDN, the expected total life-cycle cost of the system is not equal to the sum of those caused by the factorized costs [\\[37\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0037). As all agents choose the actions that minimize their respective the system-level action set is redefined as(16)\n\nIn the learning process of DDQN, the performance of the PM-DQN depends significantly on the hyperparameter in [Eq. (14)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0014). Therefore, the hyperparameter value should be appropriately determined depending on the environment (e.g., system topologies, O&M costs, discount factor In addition, there is no way to find the optimal value analytically, while heuristics require substantial computational costs for\n\n### 3.3. Step 3: parallel processing-based hyperparameter tuning\n\nFor effective hyperparameter tuning, we introduce parallel processing in the proposed algorithm. Processing units (e.g., CPUs or GPUs) are classified into five groups with different hyperparameter values. In each unit, agents explore the optimal decentralized policies using the \\-greedy algorithm simultaneously under each given hyperparameter as illustrated in [Fig. 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0002)(a). After training agents for a sufficiently large number of epochs, called a cycle, one can judge the superiority of policies based on hyperparameter values through the expected total life-cycle costs Prior to the next cycle, the parameters of the online and target networks in all processing units, and for are synchronized with those showing the best performance in the previous cycle, as shown in [Fig. 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0002)(b), thereby contributing to improving the master policy. Through the synchronization process, some rarely explored near-optimal policies can be propagated to other processing units, resulting in significant performance gains. Then, hyperparameter is tuned as follows:(17)where is an exponentially decaying step size; and In addition, when the expected life-cycle cost has sufficiently converged through comparison of results of the parallel processing, the algorithm is terminated early. [Algorithm 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#tbl0010) provides a pseudo-code of the proposed PM-DQN algorithm.\n\nAlgorithm 1.

All experiments are performed using the Keras [deep learning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/deep-learning \"Learn more about deep learning from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") Python library [\\[55\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0055) with Tensorflow backend [\\[56\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0056) on a server with 2 Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU Gold 6240R CPUs at 2.40 GHz and 256GB [RAM](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/reliability-availability-and-maintainability-reliability-engineering \"Learn more about RAM from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). The online and target networks consist of three fully connected hidden layers, each with SELU [activation functions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/activation-function \"Learn more about activation functions from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") per example. For stochastic [gradient descent](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/gradient-descent \"Learn more about gradient descent from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") on the network parameter space, we use the Nesterov-accelerated Adaptive Moment Estimation (Nadam) optimizer [\\[57\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0057), combining the Adaptive Movement Estimation (Adam) with Nesterov momentum [\\[58\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0058). DDQNs explore and exploit complex environments using the ε\\-greedy algorithm mentioned in [Section 2.3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0008), where the exploration probability ε decreases from 0.5 to 0 for every cycle along with the [cosine function](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/cosine-function \"Learn more about cosine function from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") [\\[59\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0059). For model training based on parallel processing on multiple processors, the multiprocessing library [\\[60\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0060) is implemented. [Appendix B](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0020) provides more detailed information about hyperparameters for PM-DQN.\n\nSince it is intractable to obtain the [optimal policy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/optimal-policy \"Learn more about optimal policy from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") for these examples due to the curse of dimensionality, two conventional O&M schemes and two MARL methods are also implemented as baseline policies as follows to confirm the superior performance of the PM-DQN:\n\n-   •\n    \n    Condition-based maintenance (CBM): agents repair components that have deteriorated below optimized threshold states. Since the number of all combinable threshold cases is exponentially proportional to the number of components n, it is extremely time-consuming to evaluate the system life-time cost for all policies. In numerical examples, the optimal threshold state set is explored through iterations that sequentially update the optimal threshold state of each component that minimizes the system life-cycle cost. The number of threshold combinations per iteration scales linearly with the number of components.\n    \n-   •\n    \n    Time-based maintenance (TBM): agents periodically repair individual components, regardless of their state, at certain time intervals optimized for each component. To find the optimal repair intervals, we use iterations in the same form as CBM's policy exploration.\n    \n-   •\n    \n    Subsystem-level optimal maintenance (SOM): agents assigned to subsystems independently learn policies to minimize the cost of each subsystem in [Eq. (14)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0014), where the factorized centralized cost cf,j(St) depends only on the QoS loss in the jth subsystem, cf,jSOM(Stj)\\=fSD·Lj(Stj), instead of [Eq. (15)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0015). Other than the factorized cost, the identified subsystems to which agents are assigned and the hyperparameters in [Appendix B](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0020) are shared with PM-DQN.\n    \n-   •\n    \n    Deep Centralized Multi-agent Actor Critic (DCMAC) [\\[10\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0010): agents learn policies based on two separate [neural networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/neural-network \"Learn more about neural networks from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), called actor-critic methods, each approximating a centralized policy function and the expected total life-cycle costs. Actions on individual components are learned conditionally independent of each other. The details of structures and hyperparameters tuned for DCMAC in each numerical examples are given in [Appendix B](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0020). In Example 2, to shorten the training time and streamline the process of efficiently exploring learning rates for actor and critic networks, parallelized DCMAC is introduced with periodic synchronization and compared to single-processing DCMAC.\n    \n\n### 4.1. Example 1: multi-state general system with 15 components\n\nA 15-component system is represented as a _general_ system, i.e., not series- or parallel-system, in [Fig. 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0005). All components are assumed to be Type I. The system QoS is defined as the maximum flow capacity MFsys between both left and right sides, which is 2.0 when all components operate in the AGAN state. As indicated by the hatched blocks in [Fig. 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0005), three subsystems of five components are detected based on the Girvan-Newman algorithm. By grouping components, the size of the action space is shrunk from 215\\=32,768 to 3×25\\=96, since the three agents only share information about the system state St and select actions atj for j∈\\[1,3\\] independently.\n\n![Fig 5](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S095183202300426X-gr5.jpg)\n\n1.

A general system with 15 multi-state components, simplified by three subsystems.\n\nBefore comparing the results of the proposed algorithm with those of the four baseline policies, we discuss the appropriateness of periodic synchronization in the PM-DQN. [Table 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#tbl0003) shows the average life-cycle costs and 95% confidence intervals of the realization of the policies trained on parallel units with and without periodic synchronization in the PM-DQN. The mean converges rapidly to the optimal life-cycle cost when accompanied by periodic synchronization. The standard deviation also decreases significantly, and the [coefficient of variation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/coefficient-of-variation \"Learn more about coefficient of variation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") (c.o.v.) is less than 1% after the fourth cycle (i.e., 4,000 epochs), at which hyperparameter ω is tuned around the optimal value of 4.75. Since the step size λ\\=0.25 is already small enough, the expected life-cycle cost of the policy explored at this time does not have a large difference from the optimal life-cycle cost after the 10th cycle. That is, when the step size and c.o.v. are sufficiently small (e.g., less than 0.5 and 1%, respectively), the algorithm can be terminated early without significant loss in terms of performance compared to when it progressed to the end. On the other hand, with single-cycle learning, although learning through the same number of epochs, the life-cycle cost estimates have a significant variance, and the mean cost is also higher than that of periodic synchronization. This inferior performance arises because there is no chance to tune the hyperparameter ω and explore good policies in many ways. Some outliers inevitably occur during parallel processing, but there are no other means for correcting them. Conversely, even if one or two learners find a rare near-optimal policy, these policies are not propagated to most computational resources and are not further developed.\n\nTable 3. Expected life-cycle costs and 95% confidence intervals of realization of the trained policies with and without periodic synchronization in PM-DQN.\n\n| Number of Epochs | w/ Periodic Sync | w/o Periodic Sync |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1,000 | 46.04±35.99 |  |\n| 2,000 | 33.65±3.44 |  |\n| 4,000 | 29.05±0.48 |  |\n| 6,000 | 28.71±0.53 |  |\n| 10,000 | 28.33±0.54 | 40.99±20.20 |\n\nIn this example, 5×15\\=75 and 50×15\\=750 combinations of threshold state and time interval sets are explored to optimize CBM and TBM, respectively, through five iterations. As a result, the optimal threshold state set for CBM and the repair interval set for TBM are determined, as shown in [Appendix C](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0021). In contrast, since MARL methods including SOM, PM-DQN, and DCMAC take the state combination of the components in a subsystem or a system or centralized costs as input, it is difficult to specify the damage state at which agents repair individual components. The performances of baselines and the proposed policy are estimated through 1,000 demonstrations in terms of the total life-cycle costs ctot, and the results are summarized in [Table 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#tbl0004) with the time required for iterative operation or model training. The TBM policy was evaluated as the most ineffective one due to the stochastic environment. Although the SOM shares the subsystems and hyperparameters for model learning with PM-DQN, each agent learns the subsystem-level optimal policy, resulting in higher life-cycle costs than PM-DQN at the system level. On the other hand, the optimal policy learned by the PM-DQN shows the lowest estimated life-cycle cost, which is almost identical to those of the optimal policies proposed by CBM and DCMAC. Comparing the computational time among them, the advantage of PM-DQN in computational efficiency becomes clear. CBM takes 3.5 times longer than the computational time of PM-DQN, even though search of all combinations is replaced with iterations. Although DCMAC requires about 47.5x more learning time than PM-DQN due to the difference in the number of processors, it can be shortened through parallelization and the improved convergence speed is compared on the complex system in Example 2.\n\nTable 4. Life-cycle costs and computational time of PM-DQN and four baselines for Example 1.\n\n| Method | Total life-cycle cost | Time (_sec_) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| CBM | 28.42 | 9,323 |\n| TBM | 56.71 | 99,174 |\n| SOM | 35.41 | 2,523 |\n| DCMAC (single processing) | 28.57 | 125,773 |\n| **PM-DQN** | **28.33** | **2,647** |\n\n[Fig. 6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0006)(a) and (b) show the realization of the O&M process for the individual subsystems according to the optimal policies based on SOM and PM-DQN, respectively. In these figures showing time histories of component-level costs in each subsystem, blue bars indicate maintenance costs cM,i spent on repairs, while red bars, representing shutdown costs cS,i, are not marked on the chart because all components are repaired before shutdown. Under the SOM policy, each agent immediately takes the O&M policy to minimize the loss of QoS in individual subsystems, thereby repairing subsystems immediately even minor damage at the subsystem level as if they were part of a series system as shown in [Fig. 6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0006)(a). In the PM-DQN policy, the agent managing subsystem 3 operates in the same way as in the SOM policy, because subsystem 3 significantly influences the system QoS. In contrast, the other two subsystems connected in parallel are treated even more tolerantly than the SOM, since the two act as a detour to each other and the failure of either subsystem does not directly lead to the loss of system QoS. This difference between these two algorithms is clearly shown in [Fig. 7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0007), which illustrates the annual average flow capacity loss in individual subsystems and the system under all policies. As can be seen from the results of all policies, the QoS loss in subsystem 3 plays a dominant role in the QoS loss of the system due to its series-connected topology in the system.\n\n![Fig 6](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S095183202300426X-gr6.jpg)\n\n1.

Annual average loss of QoS in individual subsystems or system in Example 1 under each policy.\n\n### 4.2. Example 2: the simplified California gas distribution system with 48 gas substations\n\nExample 2 deals with a more realistic lifeline system, the California gas distribution system in [Fig. 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0003). Unlike Example 1, there are two types of components in the system; some components located in the west, close to the Pacific Ocean, are modeled as type II components with a high deterioration rate, while the rest are modeled as Type I. The maximum flow capacity MFsys between two [terminal nodes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/terminal-node \"Learn more about terminal nodes from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") is given as 1.0 when all [substations](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/substations \"Learn more about substations from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") operate in the AGAN state. Through community detection shown in [Fig. 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0004)(a), the size of the action space is shrunk from 248≅2.81×1014 to 25+6×26+27\\=544. After resizing the subsystems as shown in [Fig. 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0004)(b), the largest action space is reduced from 27\\=128 to 26\\=64.\n\nBefore comparing the performance of the proposed algorithm with the baselines, we examine the needs for component reallocation discussed in [Section 3.1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0011). Boxplots in [Fig. 8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0008) show the expected life-cycle costs before and after reallocating the subsystem sizes evenly for learning cycles of PM-DQN. Outliers under the worst performing hyperparameters are excluded for visualization purposes. Comparing the training results up to the third cycle, in which sufficient learning has not been achieved yet, the variance of the learning rate of PM-DQN without reallocation is significantly larger than that with reallocation. This is because the policy search for a relatively large number of state and action spaces has not been conducted effectively and sufficiently in the largest subsystem 2. While their variances become similar after the 4th cycle, the former's estimated life-cycle cost becomes equal to that of the latter only after the 10th cycle is completed. As learning continues, both expected costs keep decreasing, achieving almost the same life-cycle cost. This shows that PM-DQN works well for large systems with components that have different [degradation processes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/degradation-process \"Learn more about degradation processes from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), although the convergence rate becomes lower than before.\n\n![Fig 8](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S095183202300426X-gr8.jpg)\n\n1.

Expected life-cycle costs for learning cycles with and without reallocation in PM-DQN.\n\nThe performances of baselines and MARL-based policies including the PM-DQN without reallocation estimated through 1,000 demonstrations are summarized in [Table 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#tbl0005). The optimal CBM and TBM policies are explored through five iterations as in Example 1. As a result, the threshold state set and repair time interval set are respectively determined, as shown [Appendix C](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0021). As in Example 1, the TBM policy shows inferior results due to the stochastic environment, and the life-cycle cost of the CBM policy, showing excellent performance in Example 1, is higher than those of other MARL-based algorithms. While CBM evaluates the effect of individual components on system QoS at the component level and determines the state thresholds for repair, the system QoS fundamentally depends on the combination of states of various components. This characteristic becomes more prominent as systems get more complex, which is confirmed through the performance change of CBM compared to MARL-based approaches in Example 1 and Example 2. Although the CBM policy ranks with the DCMAC and PM-DQN policies in a simple system in Example 1, it faces the limitations in Example 2.\n\nTable 5. Life-cycle costs and computational time of PM-DQN and four baselines for Example 2.\n\n| Method | Total life-cycle cost | Time (_sec_) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| CBM | 89.95 | 20,126 |\n| TBM | 161.61 | 214,140 |\n| SOM | 88.82 | 103,456 |\n| DCMAC (parallel processing) | 87.13 | 137,211 |\n| PM-DQN (w/o Reallocation) | 86.77 | 97,437 |\n| **PM-DQN (w/ Reallocation)** | **86.60** | **101,934** |\n\nThis also applies to SOM. Although the SOM policy may be an optimal decision at each subsystem level, the result of the optimal PM-DQN policy in [Table 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#tbl0005) shows that the subsystem-level optimal policy does not match that at the system level, where the hyperparameter ω is eventually tuned to 23.90. [Fig. 9](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0009) shows a simplified California gas system consisting of 9 subsystems, and the realizations of the system O&M by SOM and PM-DQN policies are shown in [Fig. 10](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0010)(a) and (b), respectively. To minimize the QoS loss at the subsystem level, SOM manages subsystems 3 and 4 conservatively compared to PM-DQN even though they are connected in parallel. Accordingly, the loss of QoS in individual subsystems is well maintained at a low level in the SOM policy as shown in [Fig. 10](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0010)(a). However, because large maintenance cost is required for the SOM policy, the life-cycle cost under the policy shows inferior results to the PM-DQN and DCMAC policies.\n\n![Fig 9](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S095183202300426X-gr9.jpg)\n\n1.

Life-cycle O&M results during an epoch in Example 2: component-level costs (i.e., cM,i and cS,i) and loss of QoS in each subsystem (i.e., cf,jSOM\\=fSD·Lj) under (a) the SOM policy, and (b) the PM-DQN policy.\n\nIn contrast, the PM-DQN policy considers the QoS loss of subsystems and systems simultaneously. Subsystems except for subsystems 3 and 4 have no separate bypass. This means that, even if agents maintain subsystems 3 and 4 loosely, other subsystems should be managed conservatively as shown in [Fig. 10](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0010)(b). In this way, system simplification based on community detection identifies the system topology and provides the basis for convergence of each agent's local optimal policy to the global optimal policy. The PM-DQN policy takes advantage of this to manage the system, thereby showing the best expected life-cycle costs at the system level.\n\n[Fig. 11](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0011) shows the training history of DCMAC with and without parallel processing. In parallel processing, the optimal learning rates for actor and critical networks are explored in the range of \\[10−7,10−3\\] and \\[10−5,10−3\\] respectively, gradually converging to the combination of learning rates with the lowest life-cycle costs. The best learning rates among the explored ones are utilized for single-processing DCMAC as well as the parallelized DCMAC. For the first cycle (i.e., the first 5,000 episodes), there is not much difference between the two results. However, the gap widens considerably right after the synchronization of parallel-trained policies. The difference never diminishes until the end of training, and the superior performance resulting from parallelization is comparable to PM-DQN; comparing them in terms of performance and computation time, PM-DQN is slightly better, but the difference is not significant considering the structural difference between the two models. This implies that the proposed parallel processing framework with periodic synchronization has a dominant effect on performance improvement and it can be transferred to other DRL methods.\n\n![Fig 11](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S095183202300426X-gr11.jpg)\n\n1.

Summary and conclusions\n\nThis paper proposed an optimal decision-making framework based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), termed parallelized multi-agent deep Q-network (PM-DQN), for efficient risk-informed operation and management (O&M) scheduling of large civil lifeline systems. Existing methods dealt with these system-level O&M scheduling problems by limiting the size of the systems or approximating them as component-level [subproblems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/subproblem \"Learn more about subproblems from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") due to the exponentially growing state and action spaces. However, these types of computational complexity reduction may incur a significant loss of accuracy. Moreover, even if the action space is relaxed, it is still necessary to find the best policy by exploring all policy combinations. To find the optimal policy, the multi-agent credit allocation problem should be solved by inferring the contributions to the centralized cost function. Unstable feedback depending on the policy selection of other agents hinders decentralized policy learning. In contrast, the proposed algorithm overcame this challenge by introducing a divide-and-conquer strategy with community detection and parallel processing. Since network clustering is based on the system topology, the subsystems identified by the Girvan-Newman [clustering algorithm](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/clustering-algorithm \"Learn more about clustering algorithm from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") can achieve an appropriate balance between accuracy loss and computational complexity reduction. The strength of the proposed algorithm is further enhanced by reducing the policy exploration time and tuning the optimal hyperparameters in combination with parallel operation. Multiple processing units derive an optimal policy set under hyperparameter tuning and periodic synchronization with the best one. The accuracy and efficiency of PM-DQN were demonstrated on a multi-state general system with 15 components and the California gas distribution system with 48 components. In each numerical example, the optimal PM-DQN policies outperformed baseline alternatives including conventional O&M policies and other MARL-based policies in terms of computational time as well as the expected life-cycle costs. In particular, the California gas distribution system represented as a general system of subsystems through community detection shows the system's topological characteristics prominently, indicating the reason for the good performance of PM-DQN in subsystem level decision-making.\n\nThe proposed PM-DQN trains multiple agents simultaneously by defining factorization cost functions based on the causal relationship between the flow capacity losses in the whole system and subsystems. Because the hyperparameter tuning and the entire process of policy exploration are performed independently across multiple processing units, the proposed algorithm has high scalability for the ever-evolving scale of processing units. In addition, the algorithm features flexible handling of the problem, such as adjusting the number of processing units according to the complexity of problems and the computing power. The parallelization remains scalable and flexible even when other MARL algorithms are used. However, there are some other obstacles arising from the limitations of MDPs that hinder the modeling and application of real lifeline network system O&M; it is difficult to consider the time required for actions in the discrete-time domain, and there is a time gap between state change and maintenance actions. In addition, if more diverse action options, such as minor repairs or reinforcements, are given, policy learning at the subsystem level may suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Nevertheless, for efficient MARL and parallel processing, the proposed framework of deploying agents and periodically synchronizing multiple processors can be applied to various other DRL methods. As shown in Example 2, vanilla DRLs specialized for parallel processing are expected to improve exploration and training stability, thereby enabling simple but powerful end-to-end learning without additional clustering or cost splitting.\n\nFurthermore, we can extend the proposed method to a [partially observable MDP](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/partially-observable-markov-decision-process \"Learn more about partially observable MDP from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") (POMDP) environment by considering monitoring errors in grasping system states. The computational cost is higher than that in MDP environment because belief function is continuously updated, and monitoring action is additionally considered. However, we can broaden the scalability of the existing algorithms by taking advantage of parallel processing and system simplification based on network clustering. Further research is underway to model state changes in the continuous-time domain and actions that take different times using Semi-Markov decision processes [\\[23\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0023). In addition, the development of such a framework is expected to achieve the scalability to cope with unexpected events (e.g., earthquakes, typhoons).\n\n## CRediT authorship contribution statement\n\n**Dongkyu Lee:** Visualization, Validation, Software, Methodology, Conceptualization, Investigation, Writing – original draft. **Junho Song:** Resources, Project administration, Funding acquisition, Conceptualization, Supervision, Writing – review & editing.\n","directory_name":"throughput/parse_document_to_pair/---\ncreated_ 2023-09-21T15_56_43 (UTC +01_00)\ntags_ []\nsource_ h_2","title":"throughput/parse_document_to_pair/---\ncreated: 2023-09-21T15:56:43 (UTC +01:00)\ntags: []\nsource: htt... #2"}
