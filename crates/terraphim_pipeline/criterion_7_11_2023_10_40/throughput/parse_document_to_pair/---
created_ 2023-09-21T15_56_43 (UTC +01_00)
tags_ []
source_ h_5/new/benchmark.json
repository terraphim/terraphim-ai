Therefore, a promising application combining PSS and equipment portrait is to establish a more refined portrait model to improve the accuracy and applicability of operation and maintenance (OM) schemes for industrial products. However, studies in the above field are facing many challenges. For example, the research on equipment portrait in the industrial field is still in its infancy. PSS and equipment portrait are studied separately, and the overall solution that integrates PSS and equipment portrait for complex products OM service is almost vacant. A personalised OM approach for complex products (POMA-CP) is proposed to address these challenges. First, a framework of POMA-CP is developed to show how the processes of refined OM can be implemented. Then, a solution of POMA-CP based on the framework is designed. A multi-level case library, dynamic equipment portrait model, and case-pushing mechanism are established and developed. Active pushing of the best similar cases and automatic generation of service schemes are realised. Finally, an application scenario for a high-speed electric multiple units (EMU) bogie is presented to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Higher accuracy and applicability for service schemes are achieved, resulting in the efficient reusing of OM knowledge, proactive implementation of refined maintenance, and reducing maintenance cost and resource consumption.\n\n-   [Previous](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S073658452200165X)\n-   [Next](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001715)\n\n##

Introduction\n\nProduct complexity has been described in the literature as having many dimensions (including the number of components, the number of modules, the diversity of relations between components, and the commonality of products in an assortment) [\\[1\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0001), [\\[2\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0002), [\\[3\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0003), while complex products are usually defined as a durable product with a lifespan of over 10–30 years [\\[4\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0004). In addition, complex products also have the characteristics of complex structure, long research and development (R&D) cycle, strict quality control and high maintenance service requirements \\[[5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0005),[6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0006)\\]. Therefore, complex products’ [operation and maintenance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/operation-and-maintenance \"Learn more about operation and maintenance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") (OM) service can provide huge potential for establishing a balance amongst users, [original equipment manufacturers](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/original-equipment-manufacturer \"Learn more about original equipment manufacturers from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") (OEMs), and natural environment \\[[7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0007),[8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0008)\\]. Complex products’ personalised OM service demands are emerging with the ever-increasing usage of customised products. As a result, many OEMs are making efforts to employ the product-service system (PSS) to provide high value-added service for their users to improve customer satisfaction and promote the implementation of cleaner production (CP) and circular economy (CE) strategies \\[[\\[9\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0009), [\\[10\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0010), [\\[11\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib69)\\].\n\nWith the advancement of smart technologies in the [Industry 4.0](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/industry-4-0 \"Learn more about Industry 4.0 from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") paradigm, the research on integrating PSS with OM services has attracted many scholars’ attention. As pointed out by Zheng et al. \\[[12](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0011),[13](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0012)\\], the combination of PSS and smart technologies can enable innovative applications of OM service for complex products. Exner et al. \\[[14](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0013)\\] analysed how OM services can be connected to the PSS to enhance machine availability while [reducing energy consumption](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/reducing-energy-consumption \"Learn more about reducing energy consumption from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and the cost of maintenance procedures. D. Mourtzis et al. \\[[15](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0014)\\] studied an unscheduled OM service of manufacturing equipment following the PSS. A maintenance planning system was proposed to facilitate [knowledge sharing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/knowledge-sharing \"Learn more about knowledge sharing from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") amongst OEMs, users and service providers within the PSS \\[[16](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0015)\\]. Recent research achievements, such as PSS-based maintenance grouping strategy \\[[17](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0016)\\], process-based OM service [knowledge management](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/knowledge-management \"Learn more about knowledge management from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") mechanism \\[[18](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0017)\\], sustainable service-orientated equipment maintenance \\[[19](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0018)\\], active [preventive maintenance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/preventive-maintenance \"Learn more about preventive maintenance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") with lifecycle big data \\[[6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0006),[8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0008),[20](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0019)\\], and lease-orientated opportunistic maintenance \\[[21](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0020)\\], etc., have provided significant references for industrial practitioners to develop and apply the PSS-based product OM pattern.\n\nHowever, the PSS-based OM services face new issues while the increase in product complexity and industrial automation. For instance, how to effectively integrate the scattered and multi-stage stakeholders and [lifecycle data](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/lifecycle-data \"Learn more about lifecycle data from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), rationally apply the historical OM service knowledge, and facilitate the OEMs to carry out personalised and refined OM services. Fortunately, equipment portrait, as an emerging technology derived from user portrait, can accurately describe personalised user needs \\[[22](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0021)\\] and construct fine-grained portrait models to analyse complex products’ operational status and fault symptoms \\[[23](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0022)\\]. Besides, equipment portrait has achieved initial success in software product development and maintenance \\[[24](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0023)\\], machine tools intelligent maintenance \\[[25](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0024)\\], and water supply infrastructures OM service \\[[26](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0025)\\]. Therefore, the equipment portrait shows great potential for addressing the above issues and realising personalised and refined product OM services.\n\nDespite the progress achieved by the researchers in the abovementioned work, new questions are arising from applying equipment portrait to personalised OM service of complex products in the [big data environment](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/big-data-environment \"Learn more about big data environment from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and Industry 4.0 paradigm:\n\nFirst, the core of equipment portrait is extracting the set of feature labels. However, the lifecycle data of complex products is usually characterized by high volume, high velocity and high variety \\[[27](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0026)\\]. As a result, it is difficult for industrial practitioners to effectively define different feature labels of products according to specific application scenarios when they are not clear on how to use the lifecycle data best \\[[28](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0027)\\]. That is, the prescriptive and structured processes for the establishment of equipment portrait models for complex products to make OM service decisions were seldom investigated. As pointed out by Liu et al. \\[[29](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0028)\\], a promising application of equipment portrait in the industrial field is the use of its model to conduct a targeted analysis of the performance of products and systems. Therefore, the authors highlight an important research question (RQ1): how should an equipment portrait-based framework for OM service delivery and execution process of industrial complex products be structured to exploit the values of portrait technology in product OM service activities?\n\nSecond, current research on product OM mostly combines either equipment portrait and maintenance service \\[[30](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0029)\\] or aligns PSS mode with maintenance policy planning \\[[17](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0016),[31](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0030)\\]. As pointed out by Grover et al. \\[[32](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0031)\\], the interaction of accessible product data and efficient [data analytics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/data-analytics \"Learn more about data analytics from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and appropriate business model can obtain more insights to improve maintenance services. However, virtually no literature provides knowledge of exploiting equipment portrait and PSS to bring out value from lifecycle data, and to carry out more precisely and prescriptive maintenance measures \\[[33](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0032),[34](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0033)\\]. This resulted in the industrial practitioners being unable to comprehensively and accurately assess the operational conditions of complex products, which makes it difficult to fulfil the current requirements of personalised and refined product OM services. This limitation stimulated another research question (RQ2): what methods can be applied to effectively integrate portrait technologies and PSS mode to extract knowledge from PSS delivery process data and to define feature labels, so as to support an equipment portrait-based decision for the OM service delivery and execution process?\n\nThis paper proposed a personalised OM approach for complex products (POMA-CP) based on equipment portrait within the PSS mode to answer both of the above questions. The proposed method can contribute to constructing a more accurate equipment portrait model based on the comprehensive, meticulous and personalised requirement information of complex products OM services. It is important to emphasise that, with the wide application of smart technologies in Industry 4.0, the large amount of data related to the product's operational status and the whole lifecycle captured in the PSS delivery processes are valuable assets for extracting the above information. Therefore, the combined PSS and equipment portrait application is not simply a study of innovative product management but provides a new paradigm for realising the preventive and refined as well as personalised OM service for complex products. The proposed approach has strong flexibility and adaptability toward complex products’ OM services in big data and Industry 4.0 environments. As a result, two such technologies incorporate numerous potentials for industrial practitioners to implement personalised and refined OM services.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organised as follows. [Section 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0002) reviews the relevant literature. [Section 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0006) and [Section 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0007) outline the overall framework and solution of POMA-CP based on equipment portrait, respectively. In [Section 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0020), an application scenario is presented to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. The conclusions, limitations, and future works are summarised in [Section 6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0025).\n\n## 2\\. Literature review\n\nThis section briefly reviews related studies in two aspects: (1) user portrait and equipment portrait, and (2) PSS-based product [OM](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/operation-and-maintenance \"Learn more about OM from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") service. The application of PSS mode creates the capability for [OEMs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/original-equipment-manufacturer \"Learn more about OEMs from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") to better control and manage their products, which in turn makes it possible to access and acquire the whole [lifecycle data](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/lifecycle-data \"Learn more about lifecycle data from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of PSS delivery processes \\[[6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0006),[35](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0034)\\]. These data can be analysed to provide sufficient feature labels set for constructing of more accurate and refined equipment portrait. Meanwhile, a promising application of equipment portrait is the use of its feature labels for specific scenarios to improve the efficiency and accuracy of OM services decision-making. Therefore, the PSS mode and portrait technology (user portrait or equipment portrait) are two major pillars to exploit the potential of lifecycle data and to carry out the personalised and refined product OM services. Knowledge gaps identified from the review are summarised at the end of [Section 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0002).\n\n### 2.1. User portrait and equipment portrait\n\nThe most cited definition of user portrait was introduced by Cooper \\[[36](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0035)\\], who believed that user portrait was a virtual representation of real users. Meanwhile, the user portrait can be divided into different types according to different behaviours and motivations. As a result, the common features of different users can be extracted and described by some labels. The user portrait is based on the real user. However, it is not specific to a certain person or user. Meanwhile, user portrait emphasises the research on a certain type of object with common characteristics and standards. Therefore, for user portraits, a virtual object usually corresponds to one or a class of physical entities.\n\nWith the advent of big data, the connotation of user portraits has changed. Gauch and Speretta believed that user portrait is mainly composed of weighted keywords and semantic web \\[[37](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0036)\\]. Teixeira et al. \\[[38](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0037)\\] pointed out that a user portrait is an information set of personal data extracted from massive user data and a model to describe a user's needs and preferences. The main challenges of user portrait applications in adaptive [recommender systems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/recommender-systems \"Learn more about recommender systems from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and intelligent e-commerce systems were investigated by Schiaffino and Amandi \\[[39](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0038)\\]. To improve the accuracy and performance of user portraits, an ontology-based portrait learning method was proposed \\[[40](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0039)\\]. The author found that the user portrait information can be enriched by integrating data mining and semantics. In the [big data environment](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/big-data-environment \"Learn more about big data environment from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), user portrait and its privacy challenges were discussed by Hasan et al. \\[[41](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0040)\\]. The authors investigated a concrete example of constructing a portrait model with [big data techniques](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/big-data-technique \"Learn more about big data techniques from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and the approach to preserving user privacy. A user behaviour portrait was developed based on the mobile phone [trajectory data](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/trajectory-data \"Learn more about trajectory data from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") to judge [airport](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/airfield \"Learn more about airport from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") congestion and provide suggestions for airport users \\[[42](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0041)\\]. A user portrait-based [transfer learning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/transfer-learning \"Learn more about transfer learning from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") mechanism was designed to conduct knowledge transfer amongst the cross-domain recommender systems \\[[43](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0042)\\]. The results showed that the accuracy of the proposed method substantially outperforms other methods. To solve the sparse data problem of e-commerce recommender systems, a diffusion-based algorithm was proposed to generate the user portrait and perform personalised and high-quality recommendations \\[[44](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0043)\\]. The experiments showed that the proposed algorithm outperforms the traditional collaborative [filtering algorithm](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/filtering-algorithm \"Learn more about filtering algorithm from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\").

The authors also analysed the influence of PSS design decisions on product reliability and OM activities. In order to increase productivity and perform accurate OM service, a PSS-based maintenance method supported by [augmented reality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/augmented-reality \"Learn more about augmented reality from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") was developed \\[[31](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0030)\\]. The authors found that the proposed method can be used to calculate the remaining operating time between failures and identify the available windows of the products to perform remote maintenance. After this, an assistance application of PSS-based [preventive maintenance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/preventive-maintenance \"Learn more about preventive maintenance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") for manufacturing equipment was introduced to improve the internal communication of Business to Business (B2B) and reduce time and cost during the maintenance service procedures \\[[15](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0014)\\]. An adaptive and PSS-based maintenance grouping strategy for complex multi-component systems was proposed to implement [predictive maintenance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/predictive-maintenance \"Learn more about predictive maintenance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") planning \\[[50](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0049)\\]. The author claimed that the proposed strategy could provide long-term dynamic planning for PSS providers. Within the [Internet of Things](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/internet-of-things \"Learn more about Internet of Things from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") (IoT) environment, how industrial practitioners can integrate real-time data and predictive analytics algorithms to manage maintenance policies dynamically and to realise PSS mode were explored by March and Scudder \\[[51](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0050)\\].

Based on the PSS mode, an opportunistic maintenance policy was developed to handle the challenges of multi-procedure capacity for serial-parallel leased systems and maximise the leasing profits \\[[21](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0020),[54](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0053)\\]. The authors suggest that the proposed policy can schedule maintenance intervals and can the maintenance decisions dynamically. A [joint](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/joints-structural-components \"Learn more about joint from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") optimisation model of maintenance and spare parts ordering policy was proposed for the use-orientated PSS to address the hardware failures and replacement spare parts problems \\[[55](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0054)\\].

An overview framework of the POMA-CP based on equipment portrait\n\nThis section outlines a novel approach for personalised product OM service. The objective of the proposed approach is to better integrate the PSS delivery processes with equipment portrait to achieve personalised and refined services for complex products.\n\nThe overall framework of the proposed approach is designed and depicted in [Fig. 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#fig0001). Under this framework, the equipment portrait model can be dynamically changed and updated through the shared data and knowledge amongst different [lifecycle stages](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/lifecycle-stage \"Learn more about lifecycle stages from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of PSS delivery processes. Consequently, personalised, refined and accurate OM service can be achieved. The proposed framework includes four components, namely (1) lifecycle data acquisition and value-added processing, (2) OM knowledge mining and service case management, (3) equipment portrait modelling and OM scheme generation, and (4) application services of personalised OM for complex products.\n\n![Fig 1](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0736584522001673-gr1.jpg)\n\n1.

[Download : Download full-size image](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0736584522001673-gr1.jpg \"Download full-size image\")\n\nFig. 1. The overall framework of the POMA-CP based on equipment portrait.\n\nComponent 1 is responsible for acquiring product lifecycle data by emerging perceptive technology and achieving data value-added by bill of material (BOM) mapping. First, the [IoT](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/internet-of-things \"Learn more about IoT from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") devices and [smart sensors](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/smart-sensors \"Learn more about smart sensors from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") are configured for complex products and their key components at the beginning of life to improve the self-sensing ability of products in the middle of life and the end of life \\[[61](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib70)\\]. For example, the real-time position and operational status data of products can be obtained through the configured GPS and smart sensors in the operation stage. Furthermore, the configured [radio frequency identification](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/radio-frequency-identification \"Learn more about radio frequency identification from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") (RFID) tags and Auto-ID devices can be used to quickly identify the maintenance objects’ information in the maintenance stage. Second, various BOMs can be established based on the data of different lifecycle stages, including engineering BOM, manufacturing BOM, process planning BOM, etc. Similarly, a service BOM of the OM stage can be built to organise the massive OM data and provide value-added data for the OM service decision-making. In this paper, a composite BOM structure (consisting of neutral BOM, instance BOM, maintenance task BOM, and collectively called xBOM) is designed to establish the service BOM. Finally, an xBOM mapping technology can be developed to ensure OM service information's consistency and traceability. Thereby, reliable and holistic data assets can be provided for the personalised and refined product OM services.\n\nGenerally, experience-based maintenance service decisions will lead to lower service efficiency and customer satisfaction. Therefore, it is necessary to mine the OM service knowledge from the historical OM data to provide powerful knowledge support for the personalised OM services by effective [knowledge management](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/knowledge-management \"Learn more about knowledge management from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and reuse (Component 2 in [Fig. 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#fig0001)). First, the information or knowledge of product fault category (e.g., fault position, fault cause, fault occurrence time) should be analysed and mined to establish the fault tree model of complex products. Second, according to the mined fault [category knowledge](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/knowledge-category \"Learn more about category knowledge from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and the case-based reasoning technology, the multi-level OM service case libraries can be constructed to organise the maintenance domain knowledge effectively. For example, an OM service case library can be divided into several sub-case libraries based on the different fault categories. Then, the fault feature keywords can be mapped to a specific fault category. These case libraries can provide valuable knowledge support for the following cases’ active pushing processes while reducing case search time and improving case matching efficiency. Third, by extracting fault symptom keywords and establishing a fault-feature [vector space model](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/vector-space-models \"Learn more about vector space model from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), the characteristics of OM service cases can be expressed to manage the OM service knowledge. As a result, knowledge reuse for personalised OM services can be realised.\n\nTo carry out the personalised and refined OM services of complex products, equipment portraits of different operating conditions and environments should be depicted accurately (Component 3 in [Fig. 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#fig0001)). Generally, the equipment portrait is made up of a label set. Therefore, the label library of OM services should be first constructed. Based on the features and requirements of complex products’ OM services, a three dimensions label library (including behaviour, attribute and fault feature labels) is designed in this paper. Second, considering the dynamics of fault features, an equipment portrait model consisting of multiple feature items (each feature item represents a fault category) and weights can be established using the space vector. Each feature is divided into attribute, behaviour, and fault symptom. As a result, two types of portrait models (i.e., attribute and behaviour feature model and fault symptom feature model) can be constructed. Besides, different model update mechanisms should be developed to update equipment portrait dynamically and periodically. Third, the similarity between source cases (in the established sub-case library) and target cases can be calculated to obtain the best similar cases, which can be further adjusted and optimised to match and generate the final OM scheme for the target products. Meanwhile, the new case should be updated in the original case library.\n\nApplication services of personalised OM are responsible for encapsulating multi-stage OM service business, including intelligent equipment monitoring, personalised OM service scheme, refined OM service management, and component defect improvement (Component 4 in [Fig. 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#fig0001)). For example, by integrating the historical lifecycle data and the real-time operational status data of complex products, portrait models of the key components can be established and updated to monitor their fault features intelligently. By combining the fault features of individual products and the recommended best similar case in the multi-level OM service library, the personalised OM service scheme for different products can be developed. The refined OM service management can realise the control and management of personnel assignment, [task scheduling](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/task-scheduling \"Learn more about task scheduling from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), spare parts supply, etc. According to the fault features and rules reflected by the portrait model in the OM processes, the weaknesses and defects information of current products can be identified. The information can support improving and updating the next generation of product design.\n\nThe logic and relation of the four components in [Fig. 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#fig0001) are described as follows. Component 1 can provide holistic and consistent data for Component 2 through emerging perceptive technology and xBOM mapping technology. As a result, effective knowledge mining, management and reuse in Component 2 can be achieved. Meanwhile, the real-time OM data of Component 1 provides OEMs with the opportunity to update the label library and equipment portrait dynamically and periodically. Therefore, the accuracy and effectiveness of the pushed OM service cases can be enhanced. In addition, the OM case library and knowledge reusing in Component 2 can provide knowledge support for constructing of label library and equipment portrait model in Component 3, which in turn improves the quality and reliability of generated OM scheme. Through Component 2 and Component 3, various application services related to personalised OM in Component 4 can be carried out.\n\n## 4\\. The solution of POMA-CP based on equipment portrait\n\nAccording to the proposed framework, the key technologies (mainly involving Component 2 and Component 3 in [Fig. 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#fig0001)) are introduced in this section, and as a solution of POMA-CP based on equipment portrait. These technologies include case-based reasoning OM knowledge management and reuse, equipment portrait modelling, and active OM service case-pushing.\n\n### 4.1. Case-based reasoning OM knowledge management and reuse\n\n#### 4.1.1. Multi-level OM service case library establishing\n\nDue to the powerful logical relation processing ability of failure mode & effect analysis (FMEA), it is widely used in fault diagnosis (especially for complex products with thousands of components) \\[[62](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0060)\\]. Generally, the FMEA for all complex product components is unnecessary. Therefore, the fault tree models of the critical components are established to conduct the FMEA in practice. A complete fault tree consists of top events, intermediate events and basic events. Due to the limited space, please refer to \\[[63](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0061),[64](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0062)\\] for more information about the main steps and specific methods for executing the FMEA.\n\nThe fault information and knowledge of complex products or critical components can be analysed and extracted based on the FMEA. To improve the efficiency of knowledge managing and reusing, a method for establishing the multi-level OM service case library based on the [FMEA and](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/failure-mode-and-effect-analysis \"Learn more about FMEA and from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") the extracted fault knowledge is developed in this paper (as seen in [Fig. 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#fig0002)).\n\n![Fig 2](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0736584522001673-gr2.jpg)\n\n1.

The structure for multi-level OM service case library of complex products.\n\nFirst, the complex products are divided into _Z_ critical component systems (represented by _[CCS](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/carbon-capture-and-storage \"Learn more about CCS from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\")<sub>z</sub>_) according to their structure and composition. Second, for the _z_th _CCS<sub>z</sub>_, it is divided into _n_ sub-case library (represented by _SCL<sub>z,i</sub>_, ) according to its _n_ fault category (represented by _FC<sub>z,i</sub>_). Third, in the _i_th _SCL<sub>z,i</sub>_, a number of fault symptoms are included. Assume that a total of _m<sub>i</sub>_ fault symptom keywords (represented by _FSK<sub>z,i,j</sub>_, ) are extracted from the fault symptom. Each OM service case (represented by _CASE<sub>z,i,k</sub>_, ) in the _SCL<sub>z,i</sub>_ corresponds to a fault feature space vector that is composed of multiple _FSK_, and contains the essential attribute of product fault and corresponding maintenance scheme (represented by _MS<sub>z,i,k</sub>_). The method of _FSK_ extracting and _CASE_ representation will be described in the following section in detail.\n\n#### 4.1.2. Case-based reasoning OM knowledge reusing\n\nIn this paper, the _CASE_ is regarded as a basic unit of OM knowledge, and each _CASE_ includes some fault information such as fault locations, categories, symptoms and maintenance measures. Therefore, the accuracy of the _CASE_ information expression will greatly affect the efficiency of OM knowledge reuse. Here, the _CASE_ expression refers to a structured description of the information in the historical _CASE_, which is a method of organising the case information according to a specific format. The _CASE_ for complex products can be defined as a four-tuple, as shown below:(1)where, describes the basic information of the _CASE_ for the complex product _CCS_, including case number, fault time, fault location, and fault [symptom description](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/symptom-description \"Learn more about symptom description from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") text, etc. (_S, E_) is the feature set of the _CASE_, where _S_ is the fault symptom feature vector of _CASE_ and represented as , including the _FSK_ () of _CASE_ and its corresponding weight . _E_ is the attribute label information and behaviour label information of _CASE_, including fault location, operating environment, operating parameters, and represented as . Finally, _Q_ is the fault conclusion, including the information on OM service solutions and evaluation results.\n\nThe method for establishing attribute labels and behaviour labels is illustrated in [Section 4.2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0013). The following content of this section will introduce the extraction method of _FSK_ and the [construction processes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/construction-process \"Learn more about construction processes from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of the fault symptom feature vector of _CASE_.\n\n##### 4.1.2.1. Fault symptom keywords extracting\n\nTo quantitatively express the fault symptom feature vector of the _CASE_ text, the text segmentation operation should be performed on the fault record text to obtain the _FSK_. As the best word segmentation module of Python, the _Jieba_ algorithm is widely used in Chinese text segmentation due to its high accuracy and supporting customised dictionaries and multiple modes \\[[65](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0063)\\].\n\nHowever, for a specific complex industrial product, the existing text segmentation tool is difficult to deal with the professional terms effectively. Therefore, it is necessary to supplement and customise the professional dictionary of _CASE_ before performing the text segmentation operation and then carry out the following operations:\n\n-   1)\n    \n    Based on the constructed professional dictionary of _CASE_, the _Jieba_ tokeniser is used to carry out the text segmentation operation, and the forward maximum [matching algorithm](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/matching-algorithm \"Learn more about matching algorithm from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") is adopted to capture the string as long as possible.\n    \n-   2)\n    \n    Based on the text segmentation operation of _CASE_, the fault feature words set will be obtained by setting a stop word table and eliminating the function words and prepositions in fault record sentences.\n    \n-   3)\n    \n    Extract the feature words used to express the OM service domain knowledge of complex products to construct the _FSK_ lexicon. Then, the Chi-square test is used to judge the correlation between fault categories and words in the _FSK_ lexicon. Finally, the words that have a high correlation with product OM service are extracted as the _FSK_. The calculation process of correlation is described in detail as follows:\n    \n\nFor a specific _CCS<sub>z</sub>_, supposing it contains _n FC<sub>z,i</sub>_, and the _CCS<sub>z</sub>_ has _N CASE_. Specifically, for a fault feature word _T_, regarding whether it contains _T_ and whether it belongs to _FC<sub>z,i</sub>_ as the judging conditions, and four values A, B, C and D are obtained (as shown in [Table 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0002)).\n\nTable 2. The relationships between categories and attributes.\n\n| Feature selection | Belong to _FC<sub>z,i</sub>_ | Not belong to _FC<sub>z,i</sub>_ | Event name |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Contain _T_ | A | B | _A_ + _B_ |\n| Not contain _T_ | C | D | C + D |\n| Total | A + C | _B_ + D | _A_ + B + C + D |\n\nCalculating the theoretical value _E<sub>A</sub>_ and difference value _D<sub>A</sub>_ of A by the following formula:(2)(3)(4)\n\nThe method for calculating the theoretical value and difference value for B, C and D is similar to A. The specific methods are not repeated here. Then, the chi-square value between fault feature word _T_ and _FC<sub>z,i</sub>_ is calculated by using the original hypothesis that _T_ is not correlated with _FC<sub>z,i</sub>_:(5)\n\nAt the same time, the chi-square value of the fault feature word _T_ relative to the whole _CASE_ library of the _CCS<sub>z</sub>_ is calculated:(6)where, represents the probability that the case in the _CASE_ library of the _CCS<sub>z</sub>_ belongs to the _FC<sub>z,i</sub>_. The greater the value , the larger the error for the original hypothesis. That is, the fault feature word _T_ has a strong correlation with the _FC<sub>z,i</sub>_. Subsequently, calculating the chi-square values of all fault feature words according to the abovementioned method and arranging them from large to small. Meanwhile, a certain number of fault feature words are screened according to a preset threshold value. As a result, the _FSK_ lexicon can be established.\n\n##### 4.1.2.2. Fault symptom feature vector constructing of the _case_\n\nThe _i_th _SCL<sub>z,i</sub>_ corresponds to the _i_th _FC<sub>z,i</sub>_ of the _z_th _CCS<sub>z</sub>_ (as seen in [Fig. 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#fig0002)), and the _k_th _CASE<sub>z,i,k</sub>_ is analysed. Therefore, _R_ fault symptom keywords (i.e., ) contained in the case text are first extracted, and then the [vector space model](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/vector-space-models \"Learn more about vector space model from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of the fault symptom feature of the _CASE_ is established. Here, the case text is regarded as a vector space composed of a group of [orthogonal vectors](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/orthogonal-vector \"Learn more about orthogonal vectors from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). The fault symptom feature vector of the _CASE_ is expressed as , () is the _FSK_, is the weight of each _FSK_.\n\nThe weight can be calculated by the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) algorithm. The TF-IDF is a feature weight algorithm based on term frequency, which is used to evaluate the importance of a feature word to a particular text in a file set \\[[66](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0064),[67](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0065)\\]. TF is the word frequency of feature words in a particular text, and IDF measures the importance of a feature word. Therefore, the weight of is expressed as a function of and . The is calculated by:(7)where, refers to the times of occurred in a certain _CASE_, and is the total number of occurred in the _CASE_.\n\nMeanwhile, the is calculated by:(8)where, is the total number of all _CASE_ in the _FC<sub>z,i</sub>_, is the number of _CASE_ that contain in the _FC<sub>z,i</sub>_.\n\nThe weight of is calculated by:(9)\n\nThe greater the value (i.e., TF-IDF value) of , the more important it is to the _CASE_. Based on the obtained weight of each , the feature selection weight of (namely the weight threshold of TF-IDF) is defined and determined by the following equation:(10)\n\nIf , the of the _CASE_ is retained; if , the of the _CASE_ is excluded. Finally, the retained is used to construct the fault symptom feature vector of the _CASE_.\n\nFurthermore, the weight can be further normalised by the following formula:(11)\n\n### 4.2. Equipment portrait modelling and OM service case active pushing\n\n#### 4.2.1. Label library constructing and equipment portrait modelling\n\nA proper label library is significant to establishing an equipment portrait model. Generally, a label is a tuple containing product attributes and values. It can be described as _Label_\\=<_Name: W_\\>, where _name_ indicates the label name, and _W_ is the weight. The type and value of weight are determined by label attributes, including numerical type, interval [data type](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/data-type \"Learn more about data type from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), text type, etc.).\n\n##### 4.2.1.1. Label library designing for complex products\n\nIn view of the characteristics and OM service requirements of complex industrial products, a three dimensions label library (including attribute label, behaviour label and fault symptom label) is designed in this paper. They are briefly introduced as follows:\n\nThe attribute label represents the inherent static attributes of complex products, such as equipment type, manufacturer, rated power, and other information. This information will not change dynamically over time and can be obtained directly from the product database.\n\nThe behaviour label consists of the operational status information of complex products, which may change dynamically with time (e.g., operational time, average failure rate, maintenance times, operational environment). Such labels can be obtained by statistical or logical calculation.\n\nThe fault symptom label is similar to the _FSK_ in [Section 4.1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0008). Such labels may change dynamically over time and can be obtained by analysing and mining complex products’ operational performance record text. For example, the [operational load](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/operational-load \"Learn more about operational load from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") is too high, abnormal wear in the bearing shell, bearing temperature is too high, etc.\n\n##### 4.2.1.2. Portrait modelling for complex products\n\nBased on the label library, an equipment portrait model of complex products can be developed. For the _CCS_ of complex products, the equipment portrait model _M<sub>u</sub>_ can be defined as follows:(12)where (_F<sub>i</sub>, E<sub>i</sub>_) represents the fault category feature vector that corresponds to _FC<sub>i</sub>_ in the _CCS_, each (_F<sub>i</sub>, E<sub>i</sub>_) is associated with a weight _ω<sub>i</sub>_. The weight _ω<sub>i</sub>_ refers to the proportion of the occurred times of _F<sub>i</sub>_ amongst all fault categories in a fixed time window. In particular, only the feature vectors whose weights are greater than the threshold _ω<sub>threshold</sub>_ can appear in the equipment portrait model _M<sub>u</sub>_.\n\nThe fault category feature vector (_F<sub>i</sub>, E<sub>i</sub>_) mainly contains:\n\n-   (1)\n    \n    **Fault symptom feature model _F<sub>i</sub>_**. Considering the name of labels in the fault symptom feature model are dynamical changing, it can be described as:(13)\n    \n\nwhere () is the th fault symptom label; is the weight, which indicates the importance of the fault feature; is the time when the label is added to _F<sub>i</sub>_; is the time when the label is last updated in _F<sub>i</sub>_. The weight consists of the local weight and global weight of the label, which is calculated by the following formula:(14)\n\n-   1)\n    \n    Local weight of the label\n    \n\nThe value of the local weight is determined by the occurred times of fault symptom label in the . To avoid , the local label is redefined as:(15)where indicates the occurred times of label in in the historical OM records.\n\n-   1)\n    \n    Global weight of the label\n    \n\nThe local weight cannot be used to measure the accuracy of different labels in identifying various fault categories. Therefore, the concept of [conditional entropy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/conditional-entropy \"Learn more about conditional entropy from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") is introduced to define the global weight of the label \\[[68](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0066)\\], which is represented by . First, the fault categories set is seen as the information sources which conform to some probability distribution, and the _FC_ and the label are regarded as two [random variables](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/random-variable-xi \"Learn more about random variables from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). Second, the importance of a label to a certain _FC_ is determined by the gain between the information entropy of the fault categories set and the conditional entropy of the label \\[[69](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0067)\\]. Finally, the conditional entropy of the _FC,_ which corresponds to the label, can be calculated by the following formula:(16)where indicates the probability of when the label appears, when the label is determined, . As a result, the above equation can be expressed as:(17)where indicates the number of _FC_ in the fault categories set; indicates the times of in ; indicates the times of in the whole fault categories set.\n\n-   (1)\n    \n    **Attribute and behaviour feature model _E<sub>i</sub>_**. Considering the name of labels for attribute and behaviour feature model is fixed, the occurred times of label do not need to be considered when establishing the . Therefore, the attribute and behaviour feature model can be described as:(18)\n    \n\nwhere () represents the attribute label or behaviour label. It contains detailed information related to the _FC_ and other essential information (such as manufacturer, component number, operational status, [service duration](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/service-duration \"Learn more about service duration from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), operational load, etc.); is the label content.\n\nWhen a label of an abnormal event appears in the OM service abnormal event log text set, it is important to map it to the corresponding FC accurately, and then the personalised and refined OM services can be realised. To achieve this objective, the [conditional probability](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/conditional-probability \"Learn more about conditional probability from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of the abnormal event label belonging to each _FC_ should be first calculated. Then the _FC_ of the abnormal event label is divided into the categories with the highest conditional probability value. The main steps for calculating the conditional probability of the abnormal event label are as follows:\n\n-   1)\n    \n    Given an abnormal event log text as a sample set, where the _FC_ is known. Calculating the conditional probability of each abnormal event label in each _FC_:(19)\n    \n-   2)\n    \n    Assuming that the abnormal event labels of the sample set are independent of each other, the probability of an abnormal event log text with a label belonging to the FCi is calculated by the following formula:(20)P(FCi|attr)\\=P(attr|FCi)P(FCi)P(attr)\n    \n-   3)\n    \n    For all fault categories, the P(attr) can be regarded as a constant, so P(attr) can be removed and P(attr|FCi)P(FCi) can be calculated separately, namely:(21)P(attr|FCi)P(FCi)\\=P(attr1|FCi),P(attr2|FCi),...,P(attrm|FCi)P(FCi)\\=P(FCi)∏j\\=1mP(attrj|FCi)\n    \n-   4)\n    \n    Therefore, the _FC_ of the abnormal event log text is determined as:(22)FC\\=argmaxP(FCi)∏j\\=1mP(attrj|FCi)\n    \n\nThe above method regards the weight of all labels as equal. However, various labels play different roles in different [text classification](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/text-classification \"Learn more about text classification from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") application scenarios. To improve the text classification performance, the TF-IDF algorithm in [Section 4.1.2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0010) is used to calculate the weight of abnormal event text labels for the _CASE_ and carry out the mapping between abnormal event labels and fault categories.\n\nAssume that the abnormal event log text of a _CASE_ has a label attr\\={attr1,attr2,...,attrm}, the term frequency of attrj is calculated by TF(attrj)\\=nj∑i\\=1mni, nj refers to the occurred times of attrj in the abnormal event log text, and ∑i\\=1mni is the total number of the attrj occurred in the _CASE_. Meanwhile, the [inverse document frequency](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/inverse-document-frequency \"Learn more about inverse document frequency from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of attrj in the abnormal event relative to the FCi is calculated by IDF(attrj,FCi)\\=logNiNi,j+1, Ni is the number of cases in the _CASE_ library of the FCi, and Ni,j is the number of cases in the _CASE_ library where FCi contains label attrj.\n\nFor the abnormal event log text that contains the label attr\\={attr1,attr2,...,attrm}, the weight ωi,j of label attrj relative to the FCi is calculated by:(23)ωi,j\\=TF(attrj)\\*IDF(attrj,FCi)\n\nFinally, the _FC_ of the abnormal event log text is identified as:(24)FC\\=argmaxP(FCi)∏j\\=1mP(attrj|FCi)ωi,j\n\n#### 4.2.2. OM service case active pushing and scheme decision-making\n\nDue to the dynamic changing of behaviour label and fault symptom label in the equipment portrait model, real-time monitoring and tracing of the CCS that frequently occurred faults can be achieved. As a result, the reuse of historical OM knowledge can be realised. Based on the dynamic monitoring of _CCS_ and efficient reusing of OM knowledge, an active pushing mechanism for the _CASE_ is proposed. The processes of active pushing of the _CASE_ for complex products are shown in [Fig. 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#fig0003). For each feature item of the equipment portrait model, the similarity between the sub-case library and the target case should be calculated to obtain the best similar cases. Then, the best similar cases are adjusted according to the target case's requirements and the OM service scheme is generated applicable to the target product. The local similarity and global similarity of _CASE_ are involved.\n\n![Fig 3](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0736584522001673-gr3.jpg)\n\n1.

The active pushing processes of complex products’ OM service cases.\n\n##### 4.2.2.1. The local similarity calculation of OM service case\n\nAssuming that the fault category feature vector of _FC<sub>i</sub>_ in equipment portrait model _M<sub>u</sub>_ is (_F<sub>i</sub>, E<sub>i</sub>_). Let CASEFCi\\={CASEFCi,1,CASEFCi,2,....} represents the _SCL_ of _FC<sub>i</sub>_, and CASEFCi,k represents the kth _CASE_ of the _SCL_. Usually, the types of label values for the equipment portrait model mainly include symbols, numerical values, interval numbers and texts. Therefore, to achieve the active pushing of _CASE_ and the refined OM services, it is necessary to calculate the local similarity for different label values. Usually, the label value types for model _E<sub>i</sub>_ are mainly symbols, numerical values and interval numbers, while the label value types for model _F<sub>i</sub>_ are mainly texts.\n\nFor a label attrj, let LS(Eij,CASEFCi,kj) represent the local similarity between model Ei and CASEFCi,k, WEj and WFCj represents the values of Ei and CASEFCi,k, respectively. Meanwhile, let LS(Fij,CASEFCi,kj)represent the local similarity between model Fi and CASEFCi,k. The calculation methods of local similarity for different label value types are introduced as follows.\n\n-   (1)\n    \n    Symbol\n    \n\nSymbol labels usually have a fixed value set, enumerating all possible values for these labels. And each value is represented by an explicit symbol. For example, the value of the label ‘_CNC machine_’ can be _JV_<sub>1</sub>, _JV_<sub>2</sub>, _JV_<sub>3</sub>, _JV_<sub>5</sub>, etc. Then, the local similarity of the symbol label is calculated by:(25)LS(Eij,CASEFCi,kj)\\={1WEj\\=WFCj0WEj≠WFCj\n\n-   (1)\n    \n    Numerical value\n    \n\nLet max(CASEFCij) and min(CASEFCij) represent the maximum value and minimum value of label attrj in the _SCL_ that correspond to the FCi, respectively. Therefore, the local similarity of the numerical value label is calculated by:(26)LS(Eij,CASEFCi,kj)\\=1−|WEj−WFCj|max(CASEFCij)−min(CASEFCij)\n\n-   (1)\n    \n    Interval number\n    \n\nThe upper and lower bounds of the interval are represented by Lj and Hj respectively, and label attrj∈\\[Lj,Hj\\]. Therefore, the local similarity of the interval number label is calculated by:(27)LS(Eij,CASEFCi,kj)\\=1−|WEj−LjHj−Lj−WFCj−LjHj−Lj|\n\n-   (1)\n    \n    Text\n    \n\nText similarity is mainly reflected in the fault symptom feature model Fi. That is, if the label is an evaluation label, the label name is a text type, and the value is the weight of each label. Given Fi and a case S\\={(attr1:η1),...,(attrm:ηm)} in the CASEFCi,k. Only the common labels of Fi and S are considered. Thereby, Fi\\={(attr1F:η1F),...,(attrnumFF:ηnumFF)}, S\\={(attr1FC:η1FC),...,(attrnumFFC:ηnumFFC)}. Let Fij is the jth common label attrjF in Fi, and its similarity is LS(Fij,CASEFCi,kj)\\=ηjF·ηjFC. As a result, the local similarity of text label is calculated by:(28)LS(Fi,CASEFCi,k)\\=∑j\\=1numFηjF·ηjFC\n\n##### 4.2.2.2. The global similarity calculation of OM service case\n\nLocal similarity can only be used to measure the relationship between Fi (or Ei) of equipment portrait model _M<sub>u</sub>_ and the _CASE_. Therefore, the local similarity calculation for different label values has some limitations. For instance, it is difficult to achieve accurate pushing of the _CASE_ and thus difficult to carry out refined OM service. To overcome these limitations, it is necessary to calculate further the global similarity between the (_F<sub>i</sub>, E<sub>i</sub>_) of equipment portrait model _M<sub>u</sub>_ and _CASE_.\n\nConsidering the dynamic changing of the label in _F<sub>i</sub>_ and the missing attribute of the label in _E<sub>i</sub>_, the structure similarity should be involved while calculating the global similarity between (_F<sub>i</sub>, E<sub>i</sub>_) and CASEFCi,k. The global similarity GS(Fi,CASEFCi,k) of the fault symptom feature model _F<sub>i</sub>_ and CASEFCi,k is obtained by summing up the local similarity of the common fault symptom labels of _F<sub>i</sub>_ and CASEFCi,k, and then multiplying the structural similarity:(29)GS(Fi,CASEFCi,k)\\=JS(Fi,CASEFCi,k)·LS(Fi,CASEFCi,k)\\=NFi∩CASEFCi,kNFi∪CASEFCi,k·∑j\\=1numFηjF·ηjFCwhere, JS(Fi,CASEFCi,k) is the structural similarity of _F<sub>i</sub>_ and CASEFCi,k; NFi∩CASEFCi,k is the number of attributes for the [intersection set](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/intersection-set \"Learn more about intersection set from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of _F<sub>i</sub>_ and CASEFCi,k; NFi∪CASEFCi,k is the number of attributes for the union set of _F<sub>i</sub>_ and CASEFCi,k; numF is the number of common fault symptom labels.\n\nIn the same way, the global similarity GS(Ei,CASEFCi,k) between the attribute and behaviour feature model _E<sub>i</sub>_ and the CASEFCi,k is obtained by summing up the local similarity of the common attribute and behaviour labels of _E<sub>i</sub>_ and CASEFCi,k, and then multiplying the structural similarity:(30)GS(Ei,CASEFCi,k)\\=JS(Ei,CASEFCi,k)·∑j\\=1numELS(Eij,CASEFCi,kj)ρj∑j\\=1numEρj\\=NEi∩CASEFCi,kNEi∪CASEFCi,k·∑j\\=1numELS(Eij,CASEFCi,kj)ρj∑j\\=1numEρjwhere, JS(Ei,CASEFCi,k) is the structural similarity of _E<sub>i</sub>_ and CASEFCi,k; NEi∩CASEFCi,k is the number of attributes for the intersection set of _E<sub>i</sub>_ and CASEFCi,k; NEi∪CASEFCi,k is the number of attributes for the union set of _E<sub>i</sub>_ and CASEFCi,k; numE is the number of common attribute and behaviour labels; ρj(j\\=1,2,..,num) is the weight of common label, which is determined by expert experience.\n\nFinally, the global similarity between the (_F<sub>i</sub>, E<sub>i</sub>_) and the CASEFCi,k is calculated by the following formula:(31)GS((Fi,Ei),CASEFCi,k)\\=GS(Fi,CASEFCi,k)·ρF+GS(Ei,CASEFCi,k)·ρEρF+ρEwhere, ρF is the weight of _F<sub>i</sub>_, and ρE is the weight of _E<sub>i</sub>_.\n\nAfter calculating the global similarity between each (_F<sub>i</sub>, E<sub>i</sub>_) of equipment portrait model _M<sub>u</sub>_ and _CASE_ of the _SCL_, the best similar cases that correspond to these fault category feature vectors can be obtained by ranking the similarity from large to small. The higher the similarity value ranked, the more valuable the _CASE_ is for future OM service solutions. Then, a set composed of these best similar cases is formed. These best similar cases will further correspond to a set that consists of some OM service solutions. According to the real-time operational status of complex products, the solutions can be dynamically adjusted (such as deleting, adding, replacing, modifying, etc.). As a result, the final OM service scheme can be generated and actively pushed to the OM service scene. Therefore, auxiliary decision support can be provided for complex products’ personalised and refined OM services. In addition, for the _CASE_ with low similarity, it does not mean that it has no value for OM service decision-making. For example, experienced maintenance personnel can help judge and verify the usefulness of the _CASE_. As a result, the modified _CASE_ according to the abovementioned operations can be updated and added to the _SCL_ to enrich the case library, and to provide more similar cases for OM service decision-making.\n\n## 5\\. A study of the application scenario\n\nThe proposed approach is tested by an application scenario of an industrial partner company. The main objectives of the application scenario study are to test how equipment portrait can be used in the OM service of complex products and what improvements are made by the combined application of equipment portrait and PSS in personalised OM service.\n\nIn this section, an overview of the application scenario is provided. Then, the established methods of the application scenario's multi-level OM service case library are introduced. Third, the active pushing processes of OM service cases for bogie wheelsets of high-speed electric multiple units (EMUs) are elaborated. Finally, the advantages of the proposed POMA-CP based on equipment portrait within the PSS mode are analysed and discussed.\n\n### 5.1. Overview of the application scenario\n\nThe partner company is a rail transit equipment manufacturer in China which focuses on the R&D, manufacturing, service and maintenance support of high-end railway equipment. The company has manufactured over 10,000 trains in varieties. These trains include high-speed EMUs, intercity EMUs, and urban rail vehicles used by more than 18 railway companies across China. Because the company's trains are mainly used in the passenger transport area, it is of [utmost importance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/utmost-importance \"Learn more about utmost importance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") for the company to prevent faults and ensure safety and reliability. In recent years, the company has developed and manufactured a series of new high-speed EMUs with a top speed of 350 km/h and 400 km/h.\n\nBogie is one of the important components to realise the running task of a high-speed EMU, which has a lifespan of over 20–30 years. It is responsible for guidance, [vibration reduction](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/vibration-reduction \"Learn more about vibration reduction from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), traction, braking and other tasks of the EMUs. The maintenance of the bogie and its key components in a timely and accurate manner directly determines the operational performance and safety of the EMU \\[[70](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0068)\\]. Therefore, it has high quality and maintenance service requirements. In addition, the bogie also has the characteristics of a complex structure. For example, the bogie generally consists of a wheelset, axle box, [bogie frame](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/bogie-frame \"Learn more about bogie frame from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), mechanical drive unit, foundation brake rigging, primary suspension, secondary suspension, etc. Each component is made up of thousands of parts. Meanwhile, all the abovementioned tasks of the EMU need to be realised by the complex movement relations between different components of the bogie. Therefore, the EMU bogie is a typical complex product. [Fig. 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#fig0004) is a schematic diagram of the H38L (a virtual name used in this paper) high-speed EMU bogie manufactured by the partner company.\n\n![Fig 4](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0736584522001673-gr4.jpg)\n\n1.

The schematic diagram of the H38L high-speed EMU bogie.\n\nIn the past, since local railway companies operated the EMUs in different geographical areas, the operational status data of EMU and their critical components in diverse conditions could not be acquired accurately and completely. As a result, the efficiency of OM service schemes for EMU based on incomplete and inaccurate operational status data was lower, which has directly affected the safety and service life of EMU. Meanwhile, the knowledge that affects fault analysis and service decision-making is difficult to reuse due to the unreasonable organisation and management of historical OM knowledge. This has made active pushing of OM service cases extremely difficult to realise.\n\nTherefore, it is important to determine how to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of OM service cases pushing and schemes decision-making for EMU to improve safety and reliability, which was the main challenge the partner company faced for a long period. Recently, with the rapid advancement of portrait technology and the wide application of PSS mode, the company sought a new way to achieve the potential of applying the lifecycle data and historical OM knowledge of EMUs for fault analysis and OM scheme decision-making and to transform its manufacturing mode from the product-driven pattern to the system-integration and the service-driven one. Therefore, they tested the novel approach according to [Section 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0006). The proposed approach was tested and followed the combination of quantitative and qualitative methods based on case analysis and semi-structured interviews.\n\n### 5.2. Establishing of bogie multi-level OM service case library\n\nThe failure reporting analysis and corrective action system (FRACAS) is the main tool developed by the partner company and its service providers to manage the OM data of EMUs within the service-driven manufacturing mode. In the FRACAS, the fault record data of the operation process and maintenance site for the geographically scattered EMU are included, which is analysed in this paper to excavate the fault information of bogie. The fault information of the EMU bogie is automatically triggered by the activation of an alarm function that setting in the FRACAS.\n\nThe FRACAS can record multiple fields related to EMU fault information (e.g., date of fault, EMU number, fault description, fault cause, fault effect, troubleshooting measure, responsible department, etc.). Based on this information, the working principle and operating environment of the EMU are further aligned to construct the fault system of the EMU bogie (as shown in [Table 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0003)).\n\nTable 3. The fault system of EMU bogie.\n\n| **Critical component system fault** | **Sub-system fault** | **Parts fault** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| The EMU bogie | Wheelset | Wheel tread fault |\n| Wheel flange wearing |\n| Axle fault |\n| Brake disc fault |\n| Axle box and locating device | Axle box damage |\n| Axle box bearing failure |\n| Axle end-cover fault |\n| Axial positioning device fault |\n| Bogie frame | Frame weld opening, frame crack |\n| Frame deformation |\n| Mechanical drive unit | Gearbox fault |\n| Shaft coupling fault |\n| Traction motor fault |\n| Foundation brake unit | Brake pad fault |\n| Balance slide bar failure |\n| Bellow break |\n| Brake disc crack |\n| Brake cylinder fault |\n| Primary suspension | Axle box spring failure |\n| Rubber mat falling off |\n| Vertical damper fault |\n| Secondary suspension | Air spring fault |\n| Levelling valve fault |\n| Differential pressure valve fault |\n| Anti-roll bar fault |\n| Lateral damper fault |\n\nBased on the EMU bogie fault system in [Table 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0003), the bogie's structure and failure mode are analysed by applying [FMEA](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/failure-mode-analysis \"Learn more about FMEA from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") to construct the fault tree model of the EMU bogie (as shown in [Fig. 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#fig0005)). The symbol and definition of each event in the fault tree model are shown in [Table 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0004).\n\n![Fig 5](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0736584522001673-gr5.jpg)\n\n1.

Moreover, the text processing method in [Section 4.1.2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0010) is adopted to extract the _FSK_ and the possible fault causes of each sub-case library. Finally, a multi-level OM service case library is obtained. Detailed information is given in [Table 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0010) of the Appendix. Based on the bogie's multi-level OM service case library, the method in [Section 4.1.2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0010) is used to define and express the OM service case. As a result, the bogie OM service case structure can be represented as a table (as shown in [Table 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0005)).\n\nTable 5.

In particular, the detailed operation instructions of the suggested solution text can be provided in the maintenance operation structured files. For example, the information in maintenance operation structured files mainly includes maintenance task name, operation number, personnel and labour-hour, task description, spare parts, operation instruction text, etc. According to this information, maintenance instructions can be provided for field personnel.\n\n[Table 6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0006) shows an example of the original record of an EMU bogie OM service case. Based on the original case record, fault categories can be analysed and judged by the method of fault symptom keywords extracted introduced in [Section 4.1.2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0010). Finally, the OM service cases are expressed and managed by the structure represented in [Table 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0005), as shown in [Table 7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0007). This mode can be further used to provide knowledge support for the active pushing of personalised OM service schemes for bogie and to promote the achievement of knowledge reuse.\n\nTable 6.

Active pushing of OM service cases for bogie wheelset\n\nTaking the wheelset of the bogie for the H38L high-speed EMU as an example, the feasibility and effectiveness of the active pushing method of OM service cases are verified in this section. Given the equipment portrait model of the bogie is _M<sub>u</sub>_\\= {(_F_<sub>1</sub>, _E_<sub>1</sub>): _ω_<sub>1</sub>, (_F_<sub>2</sub>, _E_<sub>2</sub>): _ω_<sub>2</sub>, …, (_F<sub>n</sub>, E<sub>n</sub>_): _ω<sub>n</sub>_}, and assumed that (_F_<sub>1</sub>, _E_<sub>1</sub>) represents the fault category feature vector of the wheelset. When a certain fault of the wheelset occurred, the FRACAS will extract the portrait model of the wheelset and the sub-case library that corresponds to this fault type. Then, the similarity calculation instruction will be further triggered in the FRACAS to calculate the similarity between the fault category feature vector and OM service case in the sub-case library to get the best similarity cases. The best similar case corresponds to an OM service solution of the fault type for the bogie wheelset. Therefore, the suggested solution text should be extracted from the previously established OM service case library based on the occurred fault type.\n\nIn this application scenario, the fault feature vector of the wheelset in the target case is expressed as _F_<sub>1</sub>\\= {wheel tread scrape: 0.5, wheel indentation depth transfinite: 0.3, wheel wear: 0.2}. Furthermore, the attribute and behaviour feature vector are expressed as _E_<sub>1</sub>\\= {TT: H38L, TN: G372, TMN: 3736, CN: 02, mileage: 160,782, EAT: 27, TC: hills, RF or SF: yes, FC: wheelset fault, FP: wheel tread}. [Table 8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0008) shows the cases related to the fault case library of the EMU bogie wheelset. Meanwhile, [Table 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0011) of the Appendix shows the value types of the feature items of the EMU bogie fault case library.\n\nTable 8. Cases related to the fault case library of bogie wheelset.\n\n| **Feature items** | **Case 1** | **Case 2** | **Case 3** | **Case 4** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **F** | FSFV | {wheel rim crack: 0.7, wear: 0.3} | {wear: 0.3, sparking: 0.35, brake shoe deformation: 0.25} | {wheel tread scrape: 0.4, abnormal noise: 0.35, wear: 0.25} | {wheel tread scrape: 0.15, wheel tread peeling: 0.85} |\n| **E** | TT | H380L | H40F | H38L | H30C |\n| TN | G372 | G506 | G434 | G650 |\n| TMN | 3651 | 3013 | 3782 | 3023 |\n| CN | 02 | 06 | 03 | 07 |\n| Mi/km | 113,500 | 57,805 | 191,421 | 132,560 |\n| EAT/ °C | 12 | 20 | 30 | 26 |\n| TC | Hills | Plain | Plain | Hills |\n| RF or SF | No | No | Yes | Yes |\n| FC | Wheelset fault | Wheelset fault | Wheelset fault | Wheelset fault |\n| FP | Wheel rim | Wheel tread | Wheel tread | Wheel tread |\n| **Suggested solution** | This fault is caused by local material fatigue. If the wheel rim crack is not more than 80 mm, the train can directly run to the destination after inspecting and affirming by manage department. If the crack exceeds 80 mm, the carriage should be disengaged from the train immediately to ensure the safety of the whole EMU. | This fault is caused by the poor material of the brake pad. For example, the adhesive, filler or auxiliary material does not conform to regulation. The rail transit equipment company should strictly screen their suppliers and control the quality of parts. | The wheel tread scrape and wear are caused by the failure of the electronic antiskid device due to the excessive braking force of the train. The wheel lathe needs to be replaced and trimmed to the circular. Then repair the electronic antiskid device to work properly and avoid the wheel scrape. The fixed frequency abnormal noise is caused by local depression of the wheel tread due to the too-soft material of the wheelset and foreign object impact. This problem needs to be fed back to the wheelset supplier to adjust the material. | This fault is related to the material's low yield and tensile strength. The wheelset needs to be replaced. Then the wheel lathe needs to be trimmed to improve the smelting quality and to reduce the metal wear caused by tread peeling. |\n\nBy using the similarity calculation method in [Section 4.2.2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0017), four cases in [Table 8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0008) are matched. Meanwhile, the weight value of each feature item is {0.5, 0.05, 0.03, 0.01, 0.01, 0.1, 0.04, 0.03, 0.03, 0.1, 0.1}. That is, the weight ρF of _F_<sub>1</sub> is 0.5, and the weight ρE of _E_<sub>1</sub> is 0.5. Meanwhile, set the mileage range to \\[0, 1,800,000\\], the lower limit of operation environment temperature is −30 °C, and the upper limit is 40 °C. Finally, the case matching results ranked from high to low by global similarity is shown in [Table 9](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0009).\n\nTable 9. The OM case matching results.\n\n| The case number | The global similarity of case |\n| --- | --- |\n| Case 3 | 0.8165 |\n| Case 4 | 0.7158 |\n| Case 1 | 0.6971 |\n| Case 2 | 0.6372 |\n\nAs seen in [Table 9](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0009), Case 3 has the greatest global similarity. Therefore, Case 3 can be suggested and considered the best similar case for the target product, and its solution has the most reference value. And the solution of Case 3 can be pushed to field personnel, and then the OM service for the wheelset can be carried out following the generated maintenance operation structured files. However, the fault contained in the solution of case 3 is different from the target product. For example, there is no abnormal noise problem for the target product. Thereby, the personalised OM service solution for the target product does not contain measures for [noise cancellation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/noise-cancellation \"Learn more about noise cancellation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). That is, the suggested solution should be adjusted according to the actual OM situation through artificial intervention. As a result, the adjusted OM service scheme is replacing the wheel lathe and trimming it to the circular, repairing the electronic antiskid device to work normally, and avoiding the wheel scrape.\n\nThe above-mentioned processes illustrated that the way for the personnel to confirm or dismiss the usefulness of the suggested solution is involved and considered in the application scenario study. According to the method and process described in [Section 4.2.2.2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0019), experienced maintenance personnel will intervene in the judgement and [verification processes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/verification-process \"Learn more about verification processes from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of the usefulness of the OM service case. As a result, the edited and adjusted OM service case will be dynamically updated to the sub-case library. Therefore, if the suggested solution is not the right one, the FRACAS will generate and recommend the new solution through the OM service structured document platform based on personnel confirming and editing the solution content. The interviews confirmed that the partner company adopts the human-based manner to improve operational decision-making in maintenance service delivery processes based on the actual OM service situation. Feedback to improve and adjust the system-based solution proposal for the introduction of new ones according to the actual maintenance task is necessary.\n\n### 5.4. Analysis and discussions\n\nThe study of the application scenario provides strong evidence that the proposed approach is valid and feasible, which indicates that it has the potential to be applied in the industry field for product OM services. Compared with other research \\[[25](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0024),[26](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0025),[30](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0029)\\], the major difference is the novel combination of PSS and portrait technology with the possibility of acquiring more comprehensive lifecycle data and the advantage of describing personalised user requirements and providing refined product services.\n\nThe proposed novel POMA-CP based on equipment portrait within the PSS mode makes it possible to access the product data of different [lifecycle stages](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/lifecycle-stage \"Learn more about lifecycle stages from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and trace the business data of different stakeholders. For example, the product data at the beginning of life (design and manufacturing stages), middle of life (operation, service and maintenance stages) and end of life (remanufacturing, recycling, reuse), and the business data scattered in OEMs, component suppliers, maintenance service providers, product operators, etc. These data create effective means to enable inter-connect user needs, personalised OM and sustainable competitive advantage. For example, the abovementioned data can be analysed to construct the fine-grained label library and accurate portrait model to manage better and maintain complex products while improving different stakeholders’ business processes and decisions. As a result, the complex products can be run in a better state, thereby enhancing customer satisfaction and promoting user buyback and [user experience](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/user-experience \"Learn more about user experience from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). This would be a potential competitive advantage for OEMs and service providers.\n\nThe proposed approach, along with the multi-source data of different lifecycle stages and stakeholders, allows the service providers to find more hidden fault features and match more precise OM service schemes in a shorter time. This will contribute service providers to reducing maintenance costs and resource consumption, OEMs optimising product design and [manufacturing process](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/production-process \"Learn more about manufacturing process from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), and product users reducing safety risks caused by a sudden failure. Therefore, the PSS mode, rich data, and personalised OM approach are three significant pillars for exploring the potential of the equipment portrait for complex products. These three elements provide insights to service providers and OEMs to develop and implement [sustainable business models](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/sustainable-business-model \"Learn more about sustainable business models from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") in line with corporate social responsibility.\n\nAccording to the semi-structured interviews with the managers of the partner company, in the past, even though mainly operational data of the critical components for EMU bogie were collected and analysed, the deviation between the maintenance decision and task execution is often produced. This is mainly caused by the dynamic changing of bogie operational status, fuzzy relationship, and inconsistent data transmission amongst different lifecycle stages and stakeholders. By applying the novel OM approach with multi-source lifecycle data and dynamic attribute and behaviour label library, more fault features and knowledge were found to conduct targeted analysis on bogie's operational status and performance. Therefore, personalised, refined and active OM services can be carried out to ensure the safety and reliability of EMU. This can move the service providers from planned [corrective maintenance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/corrective-maintenance \"Learn more about corrective maintenance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") to proactive and condition-based OM service planning [\\[6\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0006), reducing the service providers’ [OM costs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/operation-and-maintenance-cost \"Learn more about OM costs from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and ensuring the customers’ safety. The managers of the partner company also emphasised that the schemes of the bogie OM service case for frequent faults can provide new ideas and insights for research and development of the next generation of the EMU bogie. Moreover, other potential benefits of the novel approach, such as the personalised and refined OM service for [product families](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/product-family \"Learn more about product families from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), can be realised because of the rich portrait models.\n\n## 6\\. Conclusions\n\nMany manufacturing enterprises of complex products have transformed their businesses towards PSS modes and have integrated user portraits with relevant OM services, which helps accelerate the transition of service mode to refined, differentiated, [personalised services](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/personalized-service \"Learn more about personalised services from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). As a result, the concept of equipment portrait has received increasing attention in complex products’ OM service studies. Meanwhile, the opportunities for OEMs to accurately describe personalised user demands by comprehensive collecting the data of PSS delivery processes for complex products are continuously increasing. However, with the [permeation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/permeation \"Learn more about permeation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and application of portrait technology in industrial and complex products’ OM service fields, OEMs are facing many challenges. For example, how should a prescriptive procedure for equipment portrait-based OM service delivery and execution processes of industrial complex products be structured, and how to effectively organise and reuse the knowledge extracted from the PSS delivery process data to support equipment portrait-based OM service decision-making?\n\nIn order to address the challenges, in this paper, a novel framework and solution of POMA-CP based on equipment portrait within the PSS mode was proposed. First, the proposed POMA-CP framework contributes to the research related to the investigation of a prescriptive and structured process for the implementation of the equipment portrait-based OM service decision-making. The framework answers RQ1 by guiding the industrial practitioners in exploiting data generated during the whole PSS delivery lifecycle to improve and optimise the OM service delivery and execution processes (e.g., personalised and refined OM service), then addressing one of the knowledge gaps identified from existing literature (as stated in paragraph 2 of [Section 2.3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0005)). Second, another knowledge gap identified from the literature review existed in the lack of approaches proposed for exploiting the integrated application of equipment portrait and PSS (as stated in paragraph 3 of [Section 2.3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0005)). The solution of POMA-CP contributes to addressing this gap and answers RQ2 by introducing a set of methods in each component aimed at organizing and managing the knowledge excavated from PSS delivery processes data to establish a precise portrait model, and support the industrial practitioners in personalised and refined OM service decision-making.\n\nThe limitations of this paper are summarised as follows. First, in the application scenario, only one case record (see [Table 6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0006)) and one bogie (see [Table 8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0008)) for a specific EMU was used to test the effectiveness of the active pushing mechanism of the OM service solution. To strengthen the applicability and robustness of the proposed approach, different components for this application scenario and different types of EMU bogies as well as different operational conditions (or case records) should be considered and tested comprehensively. Second, when organising and expressing the OM service case of EMU bogie, only ten mainly features (see [Table 7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0007)) that reflect bogie fault features were selected to construct the attribute and behaviour feature vector. In order to improve the efficiency and accuracy of case matching, more features should be selected and considered to enrich the case library's information and provide more fine-grained information or knowledge for personalised and refined OM services. Third, the system-based and human-based manner are combined together in the application scenario study to generate the best similarity cases and to suggest the final OM service solutions. However, the validation test comparing human-based and system-based solution proposals and the time required to evaluate the proposed solution were not performed in this work.\n\nFuture research will focus on the following three aspects. First, the labels used to establish the equipment portrait model will dynamically change along with the different operational conditions of complex products. Therefore, a periodic updating mechanism (as stated in [Section 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0006)) of the equipment portrait model should be investigated to implement more refined OM services. Second, with the ever-increasing accumulation of equipment operational data and OM service abnormal event log text, more advanced algorithms should be considered to improve the accuracy of fault symptom keywords extracting and fault cause identification (as stated in [Section 4.2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0013)). Third, more abundant similarity calculation methods for different types of label values (as stated in [Section 4.2.2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0017)) should be developed and involved to maximise historical OM service knowledge's [reusability](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/reusability \"Learn more about reusability from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and enhance the precision of OM service case-pushing and scheme decision-making.\n\n## CRediT authorship contribution statement\n\n**Shan Ren:** Writing – original draft, Methodology, Software. **Lichun Shi:** Methodology, Software. **Yang Liu:** Supervision, Validation, Writing – review & editing. **Weihua Cai:** [Data curation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/data-curation \"Learn more about Data curation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). **Yingfeng Zhang:** Supervision, Validation.\n\n## Declaration of Competing Interest\n\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. [52005408](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#gs0001) and [U2001201](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#gs0001)) and the Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi ([2021GY-069](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#gs0002)).\n\n## Appendix\n\nTable A.1.

T…\n\n---\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nComponents in civil infrastructure systems, such as bridges, pipes, and electric wires, deteriorate over the life cycle of the systems due to corrosion of materials and other environmental factors. Component failures caused by the degradation may trigger a system-level failure event, e.g., [power outage](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/power-outage \"Learn more about power outage from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), service disruption, loss of network connectivity, or degenerate the systems’ the quality of service (QoS) like usability and [serviceability](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/serviceability \"Learn more about serviceability from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") [\\[1\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0001). Since civil infrastructure systems, especially lifeline systems including power, water, or gas transmission systems, have a great impact on [modern societies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/modern-society \"Learn more about modern societies from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), not only can each failure cause huge socio-economic losses, but system-level malfunctions multiply the damage exponentially. To quantify the risk uncertainty of these system elements, numerous studies on risk modeling based on stochastic processes have been conducted \\[[2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0002),[3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0003)\\]. Based on these modeled risk, decision-makers should establish apposite risk-informed operation and maintenance (O&M) policies considering the inevitable changes in system-level QoS and the consequences of system failure \\[[2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0002),[4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0004)\\].\n\nVarious O&M strategies have been developed for structures in civil lifeline systems. For example, time-based maintenance (TBM) undertakes maintenance based on the predetermined repair time intervals, i.e., without monitoring or criteria evaluation \\[[5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0005),[6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0006)\\]. On the other hand, condition-based maintenance (CBM) aims to perform [preventive maintenance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/preventive-maintenance \"Learn more about preventive maintenance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") based on the information acquired or interpreted in various forms \\[[6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0006),[7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0007),[8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0008),[9](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0009)\\]. Although it is straightforward to scale and apply these O&M schemes to multiple components, the introduction of exogenous variables such as the cost of system failure events hampers their direct extensions to system-level decision-making processes. This is because component-level [optimality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/optimality \"Learn more about optimality from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") does not ensure the optimal decisions at the system level [\\[10\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0010). Therefore, stakeholders and decision-makers of civil lifeline systems should be able to establish an O&M policy based on the system-level performance rather than on the conditions of individual components during the life cycle.\n\nFor O&M policy planning for a system consisting of components subject to uncertain failures, classical theories of system reliability \\[[11](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0011),[12](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0012),[13](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0013)\\] often introduce a Markovian model to handle the characteristics of the components and the system. If the same system control policy is applied over the life cycle, stationary conditions are achieved after a warm-up period. Thus, the system availability can be expressed as a closed-form expression under the assumption that components have constant mean failure rates [\\[13\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0013). However, such an O&M policy based on the steady-state assumption is not flexible enough to cope with many plausible exceptions in practice, e.g., an old road facing its service life.\n\nIn efforts to obtain optimal O&M decisions without special assumptions such as steady-state conditions in a finite time horizon, a [Markov decision process](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/markov-decision-process \"Learn more about Markov decision process from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") (MDP) has been considered as a preferred framework to formulate the stochastic processes of [structural deterioration](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/structural-deterioration \"Learn more about structural deterioration from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and the risk-informed O&M optimization. Because of the capability to quantify the expected cost or value of various maintenance actions in each state through [dynamic programming](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/dynamic-programming \"Learn more about dynamic programming from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), MDPs have been applied to establish the O&M policies for multi-state systems \\[[14](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0014),[15](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0015)\\] as well as component-level policies [\\[16\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0016) for civil infrastructures. Although MDPs have a fundamental limit in direct applications to large systems due to the curse of dimensionality, i.e., the state and action spaces increase exponentially with the number of the components, researchers have proposed relaxing constraints or seeking approximate solutions \\[[17](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0017),[18](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0018)\\].\n\nIn particular, to overcome the challenges, recent studies have applied many deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithms \\[[19](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0019),[20](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0020),[21](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0021),[22](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0022)\\] to maintenance optimization problems in civil infrastructure systems \\[[23](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0023),[24](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0024),[25](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0025)\\]. More specifically, Yang et al. [\\[26\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0026) utilized a deep Q-learning (DQN) framework for the optimal CBM planning of a multi-state system, and the framework has been further refined with the introduction of double DQN (DDQN) \\[[27](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0027),[28](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0028),[29](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0029)\\]. Moreover, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) \\[[30](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0030),[31](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0031),[32](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0032),[33](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0033)\\], in which multiple agents learn policies to achieve the minimum costs using DRL, has been considered to improve the scalability of DRL applications for optimizing the maintenance of civil systems. For example, Andriotis and Papakonstantinou \\[[10](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0010),[34](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0034)\\] have developed centralized or decentralized MARL-based algorithms, respectively, in terms of sharing or not sharing parameters related to each agent's policy for large civil systems. Zhou et al. [\\[35\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0035) also proposed MARL-based hierarchical algorithms to optimize the O&M decisions of large-scale multi-component systems. To enhance the performance of MARL, Nguyen et al. [\\[36\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0036) introduced a value decomposition network (VDN) algorithm \\[[32](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0032),[37](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0037)\\], decomposing the centralized Q-value into the sum of decentralized Q-values defined for individual agents, to find the best O&M decisions. However, although these MARL algorithms successfully reduce the computational complexity, model training or hyperparameter tuning still requires considerable time even in the relaxed environment. In the numerical examples where the existing MARL methods are applied, the topologies are quite monotonous, such as series- or parallel-systems, and the number of components is also limited.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a parallelized multi-agent deep Q-network (PM-DQN), a divide-and-conquer algorithm that utilizes clustering-based multi-scale approaches \\[[38](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0038),[39](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0039)\\], for risk-informed decision optimization of multi-state flow systems by combining the system simplification with MARL based on parallel processing. In PM-DQN, the agents observe the states of multiple subsystems identified by clustering, and learn decentralized policies to minimize the factorized cost for subsystems. The algorithm guides the decentralized policies chosen by the agents toward the system-level optimality by repeating the learning process through parallel processing and tuning a key hyperparameter based on the results with less computational cost. As a result, the PM-DQN can efficiently manage large systems that are out of control in existing approaches.\n\nThis paper is organized as follows. [Section 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0002) provides a description of the problem setting and the model assumptions for numerical examples, discusses the system-level sequential decision-making optimization problem, and introduces the DDQN and MARL frameworks. [Section 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0010) proposes the PM-DQN algorithm based on the configuration of subsystems based on community detection and the cost factorization. The efficiency and superior performance of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated by numerical examples in [Section 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0014), followed by a summary and concluding remarks in [Section 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0017).\n\n## 2\\. Background information\n\n### 2.1. Problem statement\n\n#### 2.1.1. Descriptions of system state\n\nIn this study, we consider a multi-state flow system with components. It is assumed that the initial state of each component is intact, i.e., as-good-as-new (AGAN) state. The degradation level of components is identified as one of the following discretized damage states through annual observations: _AGAN, slight damage, moderate damage, extensive damage,_ and _collapse_. We assume that the system state is observed without errors. The [system degradation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/degradation-system \"Learn more about system degradation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") state is given as a vector of component states, where is the state of component at time\n\nAs a performance indicator, the maximum flow capacity between two predetermined terminals is used to quantify the QoS of the system. It is assumed that the flow capacity of all components depends on each state as shown in [Table 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#tbl0001). Once the flow capacities of all components are determined, i.e., the system state is observed, the loss of the system QoS, can be calculated as the difference between the current maximum flow capacity and the maximum flow capacity under the initial system state through the max-flow algorithm \\[[1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0001),[40](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0040),[41](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0041)\\]. Depending on the topology of the system, each component's flow capacity loss due to the deterioration has a different effect on the QoS of the system.\n\nTable 1. Flow capacity of each component for each damage state.\n\n| Damage state | AGAN | Slight | Moderate | Extensive | Collapse |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Flow Capacity | 1.00 | 0.95 | 0.50 | 0.25 | 0 |\n\n#### 2.1.2. Descriptions of maintenance and degradation process\n\nBased on the system state information, the agent chooses one of the two options for O&M action for the component at time i.e., ‘Do Nothing (_DN_)’ and ‘Repair it to AGAN state (_R_).’ System-level action is defined as a vector of the actions taken for individual components. Although the size of the action space seems small at the component level, the number of system-level actions that a decision-maker considers each year is which increases exponentially with the number of components.\n\nWe assume that there is no limit to the number of components that can be repaired per step. When the decision-maker selects _R_ for one component, the state becomes the AGAN state deterministically, otherwise it remains the same or deteriorates with a certain probability called state-transition probability The stochastic [degradation process](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/degradation-process \"Learn more about degradation process from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of individual components is modeled as an independent discrete-time Markov process. That is, the state-transition probability for component depends only on the current state and action due to its [Markov properties](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/markov-property \"Learn more about Markov properties from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). While the state-transition probabilities for _R_ are the same for all components, the state-transition probabilities for _DN_ are modeled in two ways depending on the component types, each shown as matrices in the [Appendix A](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0019). Once the system-level action for all components is determined in system state we can define the system-level state-transition probability based on the state-transition probabilities for all components.\n\n#### 2.1.3. Descriptions of operation and maintenance costs\n\nIn the O&M process of civil lifeline systems, various variables (e.g., maintenance costs, system QoS, component malfunction) must be considered simultaneously at each time step. Because of trade-offs between life-cycle costs and the risk of systems, there is often no single solution that optimizes all these variables simultaneously. It is necessary to find an appropriate compromise among the conflicting goals. In multi-objective optimization, one can explore Pareto-optimal solutions that cannot improve an objective function without degrading other objective functions [\\[42\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0042). However, to make a decision among Pareto-optimal solutions, the subjective preference of decision-makers must intervene inevitably.\n\nOne can handle this issue by transforming multiple objective functions into a single objective function through scalarization, i.e., the weighted sum formulation. In this approach, the optimal solution strongly depends on cost functions (or utility functions) used in the scalarization process. In this paper, the objective function which is the total cost at time is defined as the sum of the multiple objective functions scaled to cost as follows:(1)where is the maintenance cost for the component is the cost due to the shutdown of the component and is the system damage cost caused by the loss of system QoS. In [Eq. (1)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0001), conflicts with the other operation costs; and which depend on the state of components and system, decrease with a conservative O&M decision, while incurred by repairs increases. Therefore, a suitable compromise between these costs is desirable.\n\nIn numerical examples in [Section 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0014), it is assumed that the maintenance cost of 1.0 is imposed when is _R_ regardless of and the shutdown cost of 1.0 is charged when component reached the collapse state. Loss of the system QoS, penalizes the system damage cost by a factor of as(2)where is a function representing the maximum flow capacity between predetermined two terminals under system state and is the initial system state vector, i.e., every component is in AGAN state.\n\nIf the term in [Eq. (1)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0001) is neglected, i.e., the objective function is given as a linear function of the component-level costs, the system-level optimization problem is decomposed into multiple component-level optimization problems. The optimal solutions to the [subproblems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/subproblem \"Learn more about subproblems from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") provide the system-level optimum. In most cases, however, given as a function of component state combinations is of great interest. Therefore, the objective function cannot be decomposed into component-level decentralized costs. In other words, the number of combinable policies to explore for achieving a system-level optimal solution grows exponentially with the system size.\n\n### 2.2. System-level sequential maintenance optimization\n\nIn maintenance optimization problems for civil lifeline system, the agent's goal is to determine a policy as a mapping from the state to the action to minimize the Q-value, defined as the expected total discounted costs to the system's lifespan as(3)where is the discount factor to convert future costs into present values. Just as the component-level [optimality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/optimality \"Learn more about optimality from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") does not guarantee the system-level optimality, a greedy optimal decision at every time step cannot assure optimality over the long run in a finite-time horizon environment. This applies to sequential maintenance optimization problems for civil lifeline system O&M throughout the life cycle. An O&M policy is defined to be better than or equal to another O&M policy if and only if its expected cost is smaller than or equal to that of for all states [\\[43\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0043). That is, the optimal O&M policy leads the Q-value to its minimum.\n\nIn value iteration \\[[43](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0043),[44](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0044)\\], considering this point, the Q-value is updated by continuously choosing the action with the lowest Q-value as(4)\n\nAfter initializing all the Q-value estimates to zero, the values are updated iteratively according to the following Bellman equation:(5)where is the Q-value on state and action estimated at the iteration. The value [iteration algorithm](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/iteration-algorithm \"Learn more about iteration algorithm from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") works well in simple environments but does not apply to environments with large state and action spaces. In particular, evaluating the Q-value of every combinable state-action pair in complex environments is nearly impossible.\n\n### 2.3. Double Deep Q-Network with prioritized experience replay\n\nTo overcome the computational limitation, Watkins and Dayan [\\[22\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0022) proposed to apply a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm called Q-learning. In the Q-learning algorithm, instead of [Eq. (5)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0005), the following equation is used to update Q-values iteratively:(6)where is the learning rate; and is the target value.\n\nThe \\-greedy algorithm is often implemented to expedite the exploration and exploitation process for Q-learning [\\[43\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0043). In detail, after initializing Q-value to zero, an agent selects a random action (i.e., exploration) with probability or the action minimizing Q-value (i.e., exploitation) with probability It is common to start with the value of close to 1 and gradually decrease it as information about the environment accumulates.\n\nIn a powerful deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework developed by Mnih et al. \\[[19](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0019),[20](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0020)\\], a parameterized deep Q-network (DQN) is introduced to approximate the Q-value. Each layer in the DQN outputs a [linear combination](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/linear-combination \"Learn more about linear combination from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of inputs and parameters. The framework introduces [activation functions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/activation-function \"Learn more about activation functions from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") between layers, such as rectified linear unit (ReLU), exponential linear unit (ELU), and scaled ELU (SELU), to describe the complex relationships beyond linearity. However, DQN tends to underestimate the Q-values in stochastic environments due to the ‘min’ operator in calculating the target value Double DQN (DDQN) [\\[27\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0027) performs the action selection and Q-value evaluation separately using two different DQNs (i.e., online and target networks), thereby avoiding the underestimation of the Q-values and stabilizing the learning process. The target value is rewritten as(7)where is the Q-value estimated using the online network with parameters and is the Q-value estimated using the target network with parameters respectively. The parameters are periodically updated to the parameters every steps.\n\nIn addition, one can introduce the experience replay [\\[45\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0045), in which agents store the experiences as tuples in a replay buffer and update the online network parameters based on a batch of uniformly sampled tuples from the replay buffer. The uniformly drawn samples significantly reduce the variance of updates owing to the weakened correlation, thereby suppressing the oscillation or divergence of the parameters during the training process. Combining these techniques, DDQN calculates the loss function and updates the online network parameters to minimize by the [gradient descent](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/gradient-descent \"Learn more about gradient descent from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") as follows:(8)(9)where represents a uniform distribution over the replay buffer and is a batch of the tuples sampled from\n\nAgents can gauge the importance of each experience by the temporal difference error (TD-error), i.e., the difference between the expected Q-values before and after the experience. In prioritized experience replay (PER) \\[[46](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0046)\\], the alternative sampling density of a batch of experience tuples which was uniformly distributed, is given as:(10)where is the TD-error; and is an importance sampling hyperparameter, with corresponding to the existing experience replay. The loss function in [Eq. (8)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0008) can be calculated more efficiently using importance sampling as follows:(11)where denotes the probability mass function of the discrete uniform distribution; and is the likelihood ratio to compensate for the bias caused by introducing the alternative sampling density The initial learning process is highly non-stationary because the online and target networks have not been trained enough. Therefore, even if the estimate is slightly biased, stabilization should be the top priority at the beginning phase of learning, and importance sampling correction may be considered later. To this end, in [Eq. (11)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0011) is replaced by , defined as(12)where is the number of experiences in the replay buffer and is a hyperparameter controlling how much to compensate for the bias. As is gradually annealed toward 1.0, starting from a low value (e.g., typically around 0.4 to 0.6), the bias is completely compensated. When combined, DDQN and PER exert a substantial [synergistic effect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/synergistic-effect \"Learn more about synergistic effect from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), thereby neutralizing a significant portion of the existing limitations of Q-learning algorithms.\n\n### 2.4. Factorization in multi-agent reinforcement learning\n\nIn addition to increasing the efficiency of DRL like DDQN with PER, dividing the original problem into multiple subproblems can be a more effective solution to overcome the curse of dimensionality caused by the exponentially increasing number of states and actions. A divide-and-conquer strategy called a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) deploys multiple agents in each segmented state and action spaces, and the agents learn policies to achieve the minimum costs independently or through cooperation.\n\nIf there are no cost functions that agents jointly contribute, a given environment can be simplified by decomposing it into several smaller independent environments \\[[30](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0030),[47](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0047)\\]. In other words, the optimal decision set in sub-problems yields the same solution as the optimal global decision-making. Then, the size of the action space is shrunk from to where is the number of agents, and is redefined as the number of available actions for the agent. As a result, one can handle environments with large spaces of states and actions based on the large scalability.\n\nHowever, in most of complex environments, cost functions take a combination of various states and actions as input, e.g., [Eq. (1)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0001). This leads to the multi-agent credit allocation problem [\\[33\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0033), in which the contributions of individual agents to the cost function must be accurately inferred. To this end, the problem can be segmented into multiple independent environments by factorizing the centralized cost into the sum of decentralized costs through [neural networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/neural-network \"Learn more about neural networks from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") called value decomposition networks (VDNs) [\\[32\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0032) or user-defined functions. No matter how sophisticated the original cost is segmented, accuracy loss is inevitable during the [factorization process](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/factorization-process \"Learn more about factorization process from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), thereby resulting in a trade-off between accuracy and scalability.\n\n## 3\\. Proposed algorithm: parallelized multi-agent deep Q-network (PM-DQN)\n\nThe MARL method combined with DDQN and PER improves the scalability with minimal loss of accuracy, allowing the MDP framework to be applied to complex environments. However, as the number of components in the system increases, the accuracy loss of the MARL method gradually accumulates, eventually leading to a failure in [optimal policy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/optimal-policy \"Learn more about optimal policy from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") search. To alleviate the scalability issue, in this section, we propose a novel MARL algorithm termed “Parallelized Multi-agent Deep Q-Network” (PM-DQN), which assigns multiple agents to subsystems based on community detection, and makes the agents explore decentralized cost-minimizing policies under various hyperparameter values in multiple processing units. The proposed algorithm consists of three steps differentiated from others as follows: (1) system simplification based on network clustering for effective agent allocation, (2) factorization of centralized costs based on a predefined function, and (3) the hyperparameter tuning with parallel processing. [Fig. 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0002)(a) and (b) respectively illustrate the proposed algorithm's microscopic and macroscopic structures of operations.\n\n![Fig 2](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S095183202300426X-gr2.jpg)\n\n1.

(a) Learning process using DDQN with PER in a processing unit, and (b) overall procedure of Parallelized Multi-agent Deep Q-Network (PM-DQN) algorithm.\n\n### 3.1. Step 1: identification of subsystems based on community detection\n\nIn optimizing MARL-based O&M strategies in large-scale systems, it is necessary to find an appropriate balance between minimizing accuracy loss and efficient reduction of the state and action spaces. To this end, we propose a decomposition of the system into a few subsystems, i.e., communities of components. By grouping deeply related components in terms of functionality or densely connected components into one subsystem, the existing system can be simplified into another system of subsystems. This can also lower computational complexity that may scale exponentially with the number of components, while minimizing loss of information. Various algorithms such as spectral [clustering algorithms](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/clustering-algorithm \"Learn more about clustering algorithms from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") \\[[38](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0038),[48](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0048)\\] and Markov clustering algorithm \\[[49](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0049),[50](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0050)\\] have been proposed for community detection. In this paper, the target system is represented by subsystems instead of the existing components based on the Girvan-Newman algorithm \\[[39](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0039),[51](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0051)\\].\n\nThe Girvan-Newman algorithm sequentially removes edges with the highest edge-betweenness, which means the probability that the shortest paths between all node pairs in the graph go through the edge [\\[52\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0052). As edges with high edge-betweenness are removed, the entire graph representing the system is divided into several isolated clusters, and the process of edge removal ends when all edges are removed. In Girvan-Newman algorithm, the modularity is introduced to stop the process at an appropriate time [\\[51\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0051). The modularity represents the difference between the actual number of intra-cluster edges in the existing graph and the expected number of intra-cluster edges when reconstructing the graph while preserving the degree of each node, and is defined as(13)where is the number of isolated clusters; is the number of edges in the graph; is the number of intra-cluster edges in cluster and is the sum of degrees of the nodes in cluster Modularity is updated whenever an edge is removed, and when it is maximized, one can identify subsystems that are separated from each other.\n\nOnce subsystems in the target system are identified using the Girvan-Newman algorithm, we can assign an agent to learn the O&M strategy of each subsystem. However, there is a problem in utilizing the community detection result for PM-DQN; since all agents must be trained for optimal decision-making for the system-level optimal policy, the convergence of PM-DQN is governed by the slowest learning rate among agents (generally the agent with the largest state and action spaces). If components are concentrated in specific clusters, the learning time of the agents increases exponentially, thereby leading to a decrease in learning efficiency of PM-DQN. Therefore, a procedure for adjusting the subsystems to an even size is necessary. To this end, after initial grouping based on the Girvan-Newman algorithm, some components in the largest subsystem are reallocated to other neighboring subsystems. In this process, the number of edges connecting subsystems should be minimized to prevent loss of calculation accuracy due to system simplification.\n\n[Fig. 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0003) shows a simplified California gas distribution system (modified from [\\[53\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0053)) with 48 gas [substations](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/substations \"Learn more about substations from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of two types and 60 bidirectional pipelines. It is assumed that the pipelines are intact during the lifetime of the system, and only the deterioration of the gas substations, whose states can be periodically identified, is considered. The system can be described by a graph model with 48 nodes and 60 edges. [Table 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#tbl0002) shows how modularity and the number of detected clusters change with edge removal by the Girvan-Newman algorithm. As the edges are removed continuously, the number of clusters increases, but the modularity peaks at 8 clusters. However, the detected clusters consist of five to seven components as shown in [Fig. 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0004)(a), resulting in differences in the action space of the agents. Since the learning rate of the agent managing the largest subsystem is lower than that of the other agents, the benefits of parallel processing in simultaneous training of all agents can be underutilized. To compensate for this limitation, one component is reallocated from the largest subsystem to the neighboring smallest subsystem 3 as shown in [Fig. 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0004)(b), making the number of components within subsystems as uniform as possible. In contrast to the previous subsystems in [Fig. 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0004)(a), all subsystems in [Fig. 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0004)(b) consist of the same number of components, so the learning rate of the agent is expected to be similar. The needs for this procedure are discussed through numerical examples in [Section 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0014) by comparing the learning efficiency with or without the reallocation.\n\n![Fig 3](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S095183202300426X-gr3.jpg)\n\n1.

(a) Subsystems detected by Girvan-Newman algorithm, and (b) subsystems with uniformly reallocated components.\n\n### 3.2. Step 2: factorization of centralized costs\n\nAfter assigning one agent to each subsystem detected in Step 1, multiple agents make O&M decisions by comprehensively considering the state of components within each subsystem. To carry out the decision making independently but efficiently for all subsystems, the total cost should be factorized into individual subsystems based on effective multi-agent credit allocation. For example, the total cost in [Eq. (1)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0001) is divided into two parts: decentralized costs (e.g., and and centralized costs (e.g., Since decentralized costs obviously arise from each component, it makes sense to impose the sum of decentralized costs of the components in a subsystem to the corresponding agent. However, allocating the centralized cost to individual agents requires the introduction of VDN or predefined functions. To this end, PM-DQN finds the subsystems that are presumed to cause the loss of system, and selectively allocates centralized costs to those subsystems based on a predefined function. More specifically, by splitting the centralized cost and summing up the decentralized costs, the total decentralized cost for subsystem is expressed as(14)where is redefined as the action chosen by agent at time is the factorized cost transferred from the centralized cost to subsystem and is the hyperparameter that determines the weight of the factorized cost. The factorized cost is predefined as follows:(15)where is the QoS loss in the subsystem; and is a subset of which is the state vector of components belonging to the subsystem. While is calculated based on the maximum flow capacity between two predetermined terminals, is defined as the difference between the total inflow and outflow of the subsystem. The structure of [Eq. (15)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0015) is similar to that of [Eq. (2)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0002) before factorization, but individual agents infer the causality between QoS losses of system and their subsystems using the min operator.\n\nUsing [Eqs. (6)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0006), [(7)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0007), [(14)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0014), and [(15)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0015), one can calculate individual Q-values for each agent In this paper, we utilize the DDQN combined with PER (introduced in [Section 2.3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0008)) for more efficient and stable Q-learning. More specifically, the online network with parameters and the target network with parameters for take the system state vector and the current time step as inputs, and respectively output the Q-values and according to each action in the form of vectors. Then, the optimal action based on the estimated is converted into an \\-dimensional one-hot encoding vector, which is multiplied with the vector form of to update the online Q-value. Unlike these online parameters that are updated every step, the target network parameters are periodically updated to the online parameters every steps. It should be noted that, unlike VDN, the expected total life-cycle cost of the system is not equal to the sum of those caused by the factorized costs [\\[37\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0037). As all agents choose the actions that minimize their respective the system-level action set is redefined as(16)\n\nIn the learning process of DDQN, the performance of the PM-DQN depends significantly on the hyperparameter in [Eq. (14)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0014). Therefore, the hyperparameter value should be appropriately determined depending on the environment (e.g., system topologies, O&M costs, discount factor In addition, there is no way to find the optimal value analytically, while heuristics require substantial computational costs for\n\n### 3.3. Step 3: parallel processing-based hyperparameter tuning\n\nFor effective hyperparameter tuning, we introduce parallel processing in the proposed algorithm. Processing units (e.g., CPUs or GPUs) are classified into five groups with different hyperparameter values. In each unit, agents explore the optimal decentralized policies using the \\-greedy algorithm simultaneously under each given hyperparameter as illustrated in [Fig. 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0002)(a). After training agents for a sufficiently large number of epochs, called a cycle, one can judge the superiority of policies based on hyperparameter values through the expected total life-cycle costs Prior to the next cycle, the parameters of the online and target networks in all processing units, and for are synchronized with those showing the best performance in the previous cycle, as shown in [Fig. 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0002)(b), thereby contributing to improving the master policy. Through the synchronization process, some rarely explored near-optimal policies can be propagated to other processing units, resulting in significant performance gains. Then, hyperparameter is tuned as follows:(17)where is an exponentially decaying step size; and In addition, when the expected life-cycle cost has sufficiently converged through comparison of results of the parallel processing, the algorithm is terminated early. [Algorithm 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#tbl0010) provides a pseudo-code of the proposed PM-DQN algorithm.\n\nAlgorithm 1.

For stochastic [gradient descent](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/gradient-descent \"Learn more about gradient descent from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") on the network parameter space, we use the Nesterov-accelerated Adaptive Moment Estimation (Nadam) optimizer [\\[57\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0057), combining the Adaptive Movement Estimation (Adam) with Nesterov momentum [\\[58\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0058). DDQNs explore and exploit complex environments using the ε\\-greedy algorithm mentioned in [Section 2.3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0008), where the exploration probability ε decreases from 0.5 to 0 for every cycle along with the [cosine function](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/cosine-function \"Learn more about cosine function from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") [\\[59\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0059). For model training based on parallel processing on multiple processors, the multiprocessing library [\\[60\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0060) is implemented. [Appendix B](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0020) provides more detailed information about hyperparameters for PM-DQN.\n\nSince it is intractable to obtain the [optimal policy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/optimal-policy \"Learn more about optimal policy from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") for these examples due to the curse of dimensionality, two conventional O&M schemes and two MARL methods are also implemented as baseline policies as follows to confirm the superior performance of the PM-DQN:\n\n-   •\n    \n    Condition-based maintenance (CBM): agents repair components that have deteriorated below optimized threshold states. Since the number of all combinable threshold cases is exponentially proportional to the number of components n, it is extremely time-consuming to evaluate the system life-time cost for all policies. In numerical examples, the optimal threshold state set is explored through iterations that sequentially update the optimal threshold state of each component that minimizes the system life-cycle cost. The number of threshold combinations per iteration scales linearly with the number of components.\n    \n-   •\n    \n    Time-based maintenance (TBM): agents periodically repair individual components, regardless of their state, at certain time intervals optimized for each component. To find the optimal repair intervals, we use iterations in the same form as CBM's policy exploration.\n    \n-   •\n    \n    Subsystem-level optimal maintenance (SOM): agents assigned to subsystems independently learn policies to minimize the cost of each subsystem in [Eq. (14)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0014), where the factorized centralized cost cf,j(St) depends only on the QoS loss in the jth subsystem, cf,jSOM(Stj)\\=fSD·Lj(Stj), instead of [Eq. (15)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0015). Other than the factorized cost, the identified subsystems to which agents are assigned and the hyperparameters in [Appendix B](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0020) are shared with PM-DQN.\n    \n-   •\n    \n    Deep Centralized Multi-agent Actor Critic (DCMAC) [\\[10\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0010): agents learn policies based on two separate [neural networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/neural-network \"Learn more about neural networks from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), called actor-critic methods, each approximating a centralized policy function and the expected total life-cycle costs. Actions on individual components are learned conditionally independent of each other. The details of structures and hyperparameters tuned for DCMAC in each numerical examples are given in [Appendix B](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0020). In Example 2, to shorten the training time and streamline the process of efficiently exploring learning rates for actor and critic networks, parallelized DCMAC is introduced with periodic synchronization and compared to single-processing DCMAC.\n    \n\n### 4.1. Example 1: multi-state general system with 15 components\n\nA 15-component system is represented as a _general_ system, i.e., not series- or parallel-system, in [Fig. 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0005). All components are assumed to be Type I. The system QoS is defined as the maximum flow capacity MFsys between both left and right sides, which is 2.0 when all components operate in the AGAN state. As indicated by the hatched blocks in [Fig. 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0005), three subsystems of five components are detected based on the Girvan-Newman algorithm. By grouping components, the size of the action space is shrunk from 215\\=32,768 to 3×25\\=96, since the three agents only share information about the system state St and select actions atj for j∈\\[1,3\\] independently.\n\n![Fig 5](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S095183202300426X-gr5.jpg)\n\n1.

A general system with 15 multi-state components, simplified by three subsystems.\n\nBefore comparing the results of the proposed algorithm with those of the four baseline policies, we discuss the appropriateness of periodic synchronization in the PM-DQN. [Table 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#tbl0003) shows the average life-cycle costs and 95% confidence intervals of the realization of the policies trained on parallel units with and without periodic synchronization in the PM-DQN. The mean converges rapidly to the optimal life-cycle cost when accompanied by periodic synchronization. The standard deviation also decreases significantly, and the [coefficient of variation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/coefficient-of-variation \"Learn more about coefficient of variation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") (c.o.v.) is less than 1% after the fourth cycle (i.e., 4,000 epochs), at which hyperparameter ω is tuned around the optimal value of 4.75. Since the step size λ\\=0.25 is already small enough, the expected life-cycle cost of the policy explored at this time does not have a large difference from the optimal life-cycle cost after the 10th cycle. That is, when the step size and c.o.v. are sufficiently small (e.g., less than 0.5 and 1%, respectively), the algorithm can be terminated early without significant loss in terms of performance compared to when it progressed to the end. On the other hand, with single-cycle learning, although learning through the same number of epochs, the life-cycle cost estimates have a significant variance, and the mean cost is also higher than that of periodic synchronization. This inferior performance arises because there is no chance to tune the hyperparameter ω and explore good policies in many ways. Some outliers inevitably occur during parallel processing, but there are no other means for correcting them. Conversely, even if one or two learners find a rare near-optimal policy, these policies are not propagated to most computational resources and are not further developed.\n\nTable 3. Expected life-cycle costs and 95% confidence intervals of realization of the trained policies with and without periodic synchronization in PM-DQN.\n\n| Number of Epochs | w/ Periodic Sync | w/o Periodic Sync |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1,000 | 46.04±35.99 |  |\n| 2,000 | 33.65±3.44 |  |\n| 4,000 | 29.05±0.48 |  |\n| 6,000 | 28.71±0.53 |  |\n| 10,000 | 28.33±0.54 | 40.99±20.20 |\n\nIn this example, 5×15\\=75 and 50×15\\=750 combinations of threshold state and time interval sets are explored to optimize CBM and TBM, respectively, through five iterations. As a result, the optimal threshold state set for CBM and the repair interval set for TBM are determined, as shown in [Appendix C](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0021). In contrast, since MARL methods including SOM, PM-DQN, and DCMAC take the state combination of the components in a subsystem or a system or centralized costs as input, it is difficult to specify the damage state at which agents repair individual components. The performances of baselines and the proposed policy are estimated through 1,000 demonstrations in terms of the total life-cycle costs ctot, and the results are summarized in [Table 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#tbl0004) with the time required for iterative operation or model training. The TBM policy was evaluated as the most ineffective one due to the stochastic environment. Although the SOM shares the subsystems and hyperparameters for model learning with PM-DQN, each agent learns the subsystem-level optimal policy, resulting in higher life-cycle costs than PM-DQN at the system level. On the other hand, the optimal policy learned by the PM-DQN shows the lowest estimated life-cycle cost, which is almost identical to those of the optimal policies proposed by CBM and DCMAC. Comparing the computational time among them, the advantage of PM-DQN in computational efficiency becomes clear. CBM takes 3.5 times longer than the computational time of PM-DQN, even though search of all combinations is replaced with iterations. Although DCMAC requires about 47.5x more learning time than PM-DQN due to the difference in the number of processors, it can be shortened through parallelization and the improved convergence speed is compared on the complex system in Example 2.\n\nTable 4. Life-cycle costs and computational time of PM-DQN and four baselines for Example 1.\n\n| Method | Total life-cycle cost | Time (_sec_) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| CBM | 28.42 | 9,323 |\n| TBM | 56.71 | 99,174 |\n| SOM | 35.41 | 2,523 |\n| DCMAC (single processing) | 28.57 | 125,773 |\n| **PM-DQN** | **28.33** | **2,647** |\n\n[Fig. 6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0006)(a) and (b) show the realization of the O&M process for the individual subsystems according to the optimal policies based on SOM and PM-DQN, respectively. In these figures showing time histories of component-level costs in each subsystem, blue bars indicate maintenance costs cM,i spent on repairs, while red bars, representing shutdown costs cS,i, are not marked on the chart because all components are repaired before shutdown. Under the SOM policy, each agent immediately takes the O&M policy to minimize the loss of QoS in individual subsystems, thereby repairing subsystems immediately even minor damage at the subsystem level as if they were part of a series system as shown in [Fig. 6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0006)(a). In the PM-DQN policy, the agent managing subsystem 3 operates in the same way as in the SOM policy, because subsystem 3 significantly influences the system QoS. In contrast, the other two subsystems connected in parallel are treated even more tolerantly than the SOM, since the two act as a detour to each other and the failure of either subsystem does not directly lead to the loss of system QoS. This difference between these two algorithms is clearly shown in [Fig. 7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0007), which illustrates the annual average flow capacity loss in individual subsystems and the system under all policies. As can be seen from the results of all policies, the QoS loss in subsystem 3 plays a dominant role in the QoS loss of the system due to its series-connected topology in the system.\n\n![Fig 6](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S095183202300426X-gr6.jpg)\n\n1.

Annual average loss of QoS in individual subsystems or system in Example 1 under each policy.\n\n### 4.2. Example 2: the simplified California gas distribution system with 48 gas substations\n\nExample 2 deals with a more realistic lifeline system, the California gas distribution system in [Fig. 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0003). Unlike Example 1, there are two types of components in the system; some components located in the west, close to the Pacific Ocean, are modeled as type II components with a high deterioration rate, while the rest are modeled as Type I. The maximum flow capacity MFsys between two [terminal nodes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/terminal-node \"Learn more about terminal nodes from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") is given as 1.0 when all [substations](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/substations \"Learn more about substations from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") operate in the AGAN state. Through community detection shown in [Fig. 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0004)(a), the size of the action space is shrunk from 248≅2.81×1014 to 25+6×26+27\\=544. After resizing the subsystems as shown in [Fig. 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0004)(b), the largest action space is reduced from 27\\=128 to 26\\=64.\n\nBefore comparing the performance of the proposed algorithm with the baselines, we examine the needs for component reallocation discussed in [Section 3.1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0011). Boxplots in [Fig. 8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0008) show the expected life-cycle costs before and after reallocating the subsystem sizes evenly for learning cycles of PM-DQN. Outliers under the worst performing hyperparameters are excluded for visualization purposes. Comparing the training results up to the third cycle, in which sufficient learning has not been achieved yet, the variance of the learning rate of PM-DQN without reallocation is significantly larger than that with reallocation. This is because the policy search for a relatively large number of state and action spaces has not been conducted effectively and sufficiently in the largest subsystem 2. While their variances become similar after the 4th cycle, the former's estimated life-cycle cost becomes equal to that of the latter only after the 10th cycle is completed. As learning continues, both expected costs keep decreasing, achieving almost the same life-cycle cost. This shows that PM-DQN works well for large systems with components that have different [degradation processes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/degradation-process \"Learn more about degradation processes from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), although the convergence rate becomes lower than before.\n\n![Fig 8](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S095183202300426X-gr8.jpg)\n\n1.

Expected life-cycle costs for learning cycles with and without reallocation in PM-DQN.\n\nThe performances of baselines and MARL-based policies including the PM-DQN without reallocation estimated through 1,000 demonstrations are summarized in [Table 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#tbl0005). The optimal CBM and TBM policies are explored through five iterations as in Example 1. As a result, the threshold state set and repair time interval set are respectively determined, as shown [Appendix C](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0021). As in Example 1, the TBM policy shows inferior results due to the stochastic environment, and the life-cycle cost of the CBM policy, showing excellent performance in Example 1, is higher than those of other MARL-based algorithms. While CBM evaluates the effect of individual components on system QoS at the component level and determines the state thresholds for repair, the system QoS fundamentally depends on the combination of states of various components. This characteristic becomes more prominent as systems get more complex, which is confirmed through the performance change of CBM compared to MARL-based approaches in Example 1 and Example 2. Although the CBM policy ranks with the DCMAC and PM-DQN policies in a simple system in Example 1, it faces the limitations in Example 2.\n\nTable 5. Life-cycle costs and computational time of PM-DQN and four baselines for Example 2.\n\n| Method | Total life-cycle cost | Time (_sec_) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| CBM | 89.95 | 20,126 |\n| TBM | 161.61 | 214,140 |\n| SOM | 88.82 | 103,456 |\n| DCMAC (parallel processing) | 87.13 | 137,211 |\n| PM-DQN (w/o Reallocation) | 86.77 | 97,437 |\n| **PM-DQN (w/ Reallocation)** | **86.60** | **101,934** |\n\nThis also applies to SOM. Although the SOM policy may be an optimal decision at each subsystem level, the result of the optimal PM-DQN policy in [Table 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#tbl0005) shows that the subsystem-level optimal policy does not match that at the system level, where the hyperparameter ω is eventually tuned to 23.90. [Fig. 9](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0009) shows a simplified California gas system consisting of 9 subsystems, and the realizations of the system O&M by SOM and PM-DQN policies are shown in [Fig. 10](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0010)(a) and (b), respectively. To minimize the QoS loss at the subsystem level, SOM manages subsystems 3 and 4 conservatively compared to PM-DQN even though they are connected in parallel. Accordingly, the loss of QoS in individual subsystems is well maintained at a low level in the SOM policy as shown in [Fig. 10](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0010)(a). However, because large maintenance cost is required for the SOM policy, the life-cycle cost under the policy shows inferior results to the PM-DQN and DCMAC policies.\n\n![Fig 9](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S095183202300426X-gr9.jpg)\n\n1.

Life-cycle O&M results during an epoch in Example 2: component-level costs (i.e., cM,i and cS,i) and loss of QoS in each subsystem (i.e., cf,jSOM\\=fSD·Lj) under (a) the SOM policy, and (b) the PM-DQN policy.\n\nIn contrast, the PM-DQN policy considers the QoS loss of subsystems and systems simultaneously. Subsystems except for subsystems 3 and 4 have no separate bypass. This means that, even if agents maintain subsystems 3 and 4 loosely, other subsystems should be managed conservatively as shown in [Fig. 10](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0010)(b). In this way, system simplification based on community detection identifies the system topology and provides the basis for convergence of each agent's local optimal policy to the global optimal policy. The PM-DQN policy takes advantage of this to manage the system, thereby showing the best expected life-cycle costs at the system level.\n\n[Fig. 11](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0011) shows the training history of DCMAC with and without parallel processing. In parallel processing, the optimal learning rates for actor and critical networks are explored in the range of \\[10−7,10−3\\] and \\[10−5,10−3\\] respectively, gradually converging to the combination of learning rates with the lowest life-cycle costs. The best learning rates among the explored ones are utilized for single-processing DCMAC as well as the parallelized DCMAC. For the first cycle (i.e., the first 5,000 episodes), there is not much difference between the two results. However, the gap widens considerably right after the synchronization of parallel-trained policies. The difference never diminishes until the end of training, and the superior performance resulting from parallelization is comparable to PM-DQN; comparing them in terms of performance and computation time, PM-DQN is slightly better, but the difference is not significant considering the structural difference between the two models. This implies that the proposed parallel processing framework with periodic synchronization has a dominant effect on performance improvement and it can be transferred to other DRL methods.\n\n![Fig 11](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S095183202300426X-gr11.jpg)\n\n1.

Training history of original and parallelized DCMAC with 95% confidence intervals in Example 2.\n\n## 5\\. Summary and conclusions\n\nThis paper proposed an optimal decision-making framework based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), termed parallelized multi-agent deep Q-network (PM-DQN), for efficient risk-informed operation and management (O&M) scheduling of large civil lifeline systems. Existing methods dealt with these system-level O&M scheduling problems by limiting the size of the systems or approximating them as component-level [subproblems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/subproblem \"Learn more about subproblems from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") due to the exponentially growing state and action spaces. However, these types of computational complexity reduction may incur a significant loss of accuracy. Moreover, even if the action space is relaxed, it is still necessary to find the best policy by exploring all policy combinations. To find the optimal policy, the multi-agent credit allocation problem should be solved by inferring the contributions to the centralized cost function. Unstable feedback depending on the policy selection of other agents hinders decentralized policy learning. In contrast, the proposed algorithm overcame this challenge by introducing a divide-and-conquer strategy with community detection and parallel processing. Since network clustering is based on the system topology, the subsystems identified by the Girvan-Newman [clustering algorithm](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/clustering-algorithm \"Learn more about clustering algorithm from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") can achieve an appropriate balance between accuracy loss and computational complexity reduction. The strength of the proposed algorithm is further enhanced by reducing the policy exploration time and tuning the optimal hyperparameters in combination with parallel operation. Multiple processing units derive an optimal policy set under hyperparameter tuning and periodic synchronization with the best one. The accuracy and efficiency of PM-DQN were demonstrated on a multi-state general system with 15 components and the California gas distribution system with 48 components. In each numerical example, the optimal PM-DQN policies outperformed baseline alternatives including conventional O&M policies and other MARL-based policies in terms of computational time as well as the expected life-cycle costs. In particular, the California gas distribution system represented as a general system of subsystems through community detection shows the system's topological characteristics prominently, indicating the reason for the good performance of PM-DQN in subsystem level decision-making.\n\nThe proposed PM-DQN trains multiple agents simultaneously by defining factorization cost functions based on the causal relationship between the flow capacity losses in the whole system and subsystems. Because the hyperparameter tuning and the entire process of policy exploration are performed independently across multiple processing units, the proposed algorithm has high scalability for the ever-evolving scale of processing units. In addition, the algorithm features flexible handling of the problem, such as adjusting the number of processing units according to the complexity of problems and the computing power. The parallelization remains scalable and flexible even when other MARL algorithms are used. However, there are some other obstacles arising from the limitations of MDPs that hinder the modeling and application of real lifeline network system O&M; it is difficult to consider the time required for actions in the discrete-time domain, and there is a time gap between state change and maintenance actions. In addition, if more diverse action options, such as minor repairs or reinforcements, are given, policy learning at the subsystem level may suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Nevertheless, for efficient MARL and parallel processing, the proposed framework of deploying agents and periodically synchronizing multiple processors can be applied to various other DRL methods. As shown in Example 2, vanilla DRLs specialized for parallel processing are expected to improve exploration and training stability, thereby enabling simple but powerful end-to-end learning without additional clustering or cost splitting.\n\nFurthermore, we can extend the proposed method to a [partially observable MDP](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/partially-observable-markov-decision-process \"Learn more about partially observable MDP from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") (POMDP) environment by considering monitoring errors in grasping system states. The computational cost is higher than that in MDP environment because belief function is continuously updated, and monitoring action is additionally considered. However, we can broaden the scalability of the existing algorithms by taking advantage of parallel processing and system simplification based on network clustering. Further research is underway to model state changes in the continuous-time domain and actions that take different times using Semi-Markov decision processes [\\[23\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0023). In addition, the development of such a framework is expected to achieve the scalability to cope with unexpected events (e.g., earthquakes, typhoons).\n\n## CRediT authorship contribution statement\n\n**Dongkyu Lee:** Visualization, Validation, Software, Methodology, Conceptualization, Investigation, Writing – original draft. **Junho Song:** Resources, Project administration, Funding acquisition, Conceptualization, Supervision, Writing – review & editing.\n---\ncreated: 2023-09-21T15:53:57 (UTC +01:00)\ntags: []\nsource: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347\nauthor: Rongqi Chen\n---\n\n# Intelligent safe operation and maintenance of oil and gas production systems: Connotations and key technologies - ScienceDirect\n\n> ## Excerpt\n> Oil and gas production systems have the characteristics of high operation and maintenance risk and great accident influence.

Introduction\n\nAs a typical high-risk industry, oil and gas production is characterized by a wide variety of equipment and facilities, complex processes, and harsh working environments \\[[1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#bib1)\\]. Although the overall safe production situation is controllable, inherent risks persist for a long time, and risk prevention capabilities in professional fields need to be continually strengthened. In recent years, the “short board effect” and “cask effect” of risk management in the process of oil and gas production have become increasingly prominent, mainly because the risk of blowout has not been thoroughly removed, refining equipment and tanks occasionally explode, and accidents involving fatalities in high-risk operations frequently occur \\[[2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#bib2)\\]. Consequently, it is necessary to improve the digitization, networking, and intelligence levels of the [operation and maintenance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/operation-and-maintenance \"Learn more about operation and maintenance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of oil and gas production systems to reduce risks, improve the safety of operation sites, and promote the digital transformation of the [oil and gas industry](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/petroleum-industry \"Learn more about oil and gas industry from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") \\[[3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#bib3)\\].\n\nAs the core of digital transformation \\[[4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#bib4)\\], operation and maintenance have gradually developed from the original mechanized post-operation mode driven by steam technology to the automatic regular mode driven by [power technology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/power-engineering \"Learn more about power technology from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). Currently, with the emergence of information technology, combined with the promotion of information technology and visual operation and maintenance by computer and network technology, the real-time monitoring and online evaluation of equipment operation can be achieved, enabling the timely detection and maintenance of anomalies \\[[5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#bib5)\\]. The world is currently experiencing the fourth industrial revolution. The new generation of digital technology promotes comprehensive integration with industry, bringing about fundamental changes in production and management methods. Using information technologies such as big data, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and digital twin, combined with [physical modeling](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/physical-modeling \"Learn more about physical modeling from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and mechanism analysis to evaluate equipment operation status, intelligent operation and maintenance enables the identification of fault modes, estimations of their severity, and predictions of remaining life. This effectively optimizes operation and maintenance decisions and allows maintenance activities to be organized in a reasonable manner \\[[6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#bib6)\\].\n\nOil and gas production systems are characterized by high operation and maintenance risks, and high susceptibility to accidents. Conventional operation and maintenance methods cannot effectively perceive and handle abnormal events in a timely manner \\[[7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#bib7)\\]. In recent years, domestic and foreign oil and gas enterprises have made significant progress in areas such as drilling safety, gathering and transportation safety \\[[8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#bib8)\\], and remote operation and maintenance \\[[9](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#bib9)\\]. The accelerated transformation of safe production from static analysis to dynamic perception, from post-emergency response to prevention, and from single-point prevention and control to [joint](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/joints-structural-components \"Learn more about joint from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") prevention has enhanced the safety of oil and gas production systems and achieved high-quality developments in the oil and gas industry \\[[10](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#bib10)\\]. However, there is still room for improvement in key technologies underlying the intelligent and safe operation and maintenance of oil and gas production systems. Thus, it is necessary to develop an innovative safe production technology system with desirable information, digitization, and intelligence through the integration of emerging technologies, to enhance the perception, monitoring, early warning, disposal, and evaluation capabilities of the oil and gas industry \\[[11](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#bib11)\\]. The shift from conventional techniques to intelligent and safe operation and maintenance makes it possible to cultivate and promote new models of intelligent operation and maintenance services, thereby ensuring the safe and reliable operation of production equipment \\[[12](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#bib12)\\]. In view of the current urgent demands for the digital transformation of oil and gas production, operation, and maintenance, this paper summarizes advanced technologies such as big data, digital twin, machine learning, and edge computing, define the connotation and key elements of intelligent safe operation and maintenance technology, analyze the existing problems and challenges, and construct an intelligent safe operation and maintenance technology system for the oil and gas industry. Research results provide technical support for fault-free oil and gas production, and promote the digital transformation of the conventional energy industry and the implementation of intelligent safe operation and maintenance technologies. In addition, the research results contribute to the safety of oil and gas production fields and promote the safe and healthy development of the oil and gas industry.\n\n## 2\\. Connotation of intelligent safe operation and maintenance technology for oil and gas production\n\n### 2.1. Definition of intelligent safe operation and maintenance for oil and gas production\n\nIntelligent [operation and maintenance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/operation-and-maintenance \"Learn more about operation and maintenance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") refers to the use of new-generation [information and communication technologies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/information-and-communication-technologies \"Learn more about information and communication technologies from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") (e.g., cloud computing, big data, the internet-of-things, and artificial intelligence) to achieve dynamic self-decision-making in oil and gas production systems. Intelligent and safe operation and maintenance in oil and gas production systems cover the entire process of oil and gas drilling, transportation, storage, refining, and [chemical engineering](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/chemical-engineering \"Learn more about chemical engineering from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), including health management, risk assessment, visual management, intelligent warning, risk prediction, and other operation and maintenance operations \\[[13](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#bib13),[14](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#bib14)\\], as shown in [Fig. 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#fig1). First, it is necessary to use edge-perception technology to acquire on-site production data, and then realize information modeling, data governance, and multi-source heterogeneous data integration based on big data technology. The aim is to fully utilize the value of data through functional algorithms and intelligent application models, enabling analysis of the intrinsic nature of monitoring data. Finally, combined with operation and maintenance service modules, this will achieve the operation and maintenance of the entire process, elements, and lifecycle of the oil and gas production system. Considering data management as the key, algorithms as the foundation, and operation and maintenance service as the platform, the deep integration of digital technology and traditional oil and gas production technology then makes it possible to continuously improve the level of digitization, networking, and intelligence of oil and gas production systems, and realize a digital transformation from conventional operation and maintenance to intelligent safe operation and maintenance.\n\n![Fig. 1](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2352854023000347-gr1.jpg)\n\n1.

Framework of intelligent safe operation and maintenance technology for oil and gas production.\n\n### 2.2. Key elements of intelligent safe operation and maintenance of oil and gas production\n\nOil and gas production systems have inherent risks. Existing risk prevention capabilities in different professional fields and key links still need to be strengthened \\[[15](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#bib15)\\]. Thus, intelligent safe operation and maintenance should start from three key elements: equipment safety, job safety, and process safety. By promoting the integration and innovation of oil and gas production with intelligent technology, potential dangers are fundamentally eliminated and the essential safety level of key core links in oil and gas production is improved, ultimately leading to safer development of oil and gas production systems.\n\nThe normal and stable operation of production equipment and facilities is the key to oil and gas systems \\[[16](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#bib16)\\]. Intelligent safe operation and maintenance provide technical support for on-site monitoring, fault warning, fault diagnosis, status evaluation, and other functions of critical equipment. There are various operations in the oil and gas production process, and the on-site situation is complex. Typically, there are multiple risk interference effects between operations, and the [operational risks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/operational-risk \"Learn more about operational risks from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") change dynamically \\[[17](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#bib17)\\]. Therefore, it is necessary to implement intelligent safe operation and maintenance systems in all key risk management and emergency response measures, as this will minimize the probability of accidents during the operation process. Oil and gas production covers the entire industrial chain from drilling and extraction to transportation, storage, refining, finished product processing, sales, and other upstream, midstream, and downstream industries, as shown in [Fig. 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#fig2). Therefore, it is necessary to establish a full factor oil and gas production safety framework. There are six factors that affect the stable operation of oil and gas production systems: (1) human, (2) equipment, (3) material, (4) technology, (5) environment, and (6) management. By considering these factors comprehensively, intelligent safe operation and maintenance can achieve safe production, improved quality and efficiency, and reduced costs. Based on monitoring data relating to the status of oil and gas production equipment and facilities, an intelligent safe operation and maintenance system can acquire performance indicators, speculate on key nodes of equipment failure, predict potential failure links, and ultimately ensure the safety of oil and gas production equipment. By collecting and sorting data, the intelligent safe operation and maintenance system can identify hazards, determine the degree of risk, and provide specific risk-mitigation measures to ensure the safety of oil and gas production. By constructing a production process model, an adaptive warning analysis method can be established to simulate actual working conditions and achieve risk prediction, thereby ensuring the safety of the oil and gas production process.\n\n![Fig. 2](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2352854023000347-gr2.jpg)\n\n1.

Framework for full-factor oil and gas production safety.\n\n### 2.3. Problems and challenges in intelligent safe operation and maintenance of oil and gas production\n\nTo date, there has been considerable research on the intelligent and safe operation and maintenance of oil and gas production. However, many problems and challenges remain in the acquisition and analysis of multi-source data relating to oil and gas field production safety, multi-dimensional and multi-scale risk evolution in oil and gas fields, and collaborative optimization and implementation on the industrial internet. This paper outlines three major challenges and four key issues that urgently need to be addressed in intelligent safe operation and maintenance.\n\nThe three major challenges are as follows: ① Difficulty of technical research. Typically, the traditional operation mode suffers from the fragmentation of data, prevalence of information silos, long development cycles, and inability to respond flexibly and quickly to new demands. This makes it difficult to satisfy the future demands for production and digital transformation. ② Weak ubiquitous perception. With numerous links and diverse risk factors, oil and gas production systems are very complicated. In certain specific business scenarios, intelligent exploration can be achieved, but few perception technologies can be applied. A system's ubiquitous perception ability needs to be further enhanced. ③ Difficulty of platform unification. The development and application of intelligent algorithms based on specific business scenarios are complicated by inconsistent data standards and isolated application systems \\[[18](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#bib18)\\]. Under such circumstances, it is difficult to construct a unified platform for data collection, transmission, application, centralized storage, and sharing.\n\nAt present, there are four key issues in intelligent security operation and maintenance.\n\n-   **1)**\n    \n    Evolution mechanism and risk characterization of multidimensional and multi-scale risks in the [oil and gas industry](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/petroleum-industry \"Learn more about oil and gas industry from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\").\n    \n\nThe failure or abnormality of a single item of production equipment may lead to the failure of other equipment, causing the fault to propagate. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the forms and rules of risk propagation across space \\[[19](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#bib19)\\]. By studying the risk propagation mechanism, it is possible to clarify the [directionality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/directionality \"Learn more about directionality from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and dependency relationships within the system, evaluate the risk evolution status, and construct a risk evolution model. This clarifies the causes and evolution processes of risks, and elucidates the risk propagation mechanism across devices, space, and time, ultimately revealing the risk evolution mechanism.\n\n-   **2)**\n    \n    **Multi-source heterogeneous big data integration and analysis in oil and gas field production safe operation and maintenance system.**\n    \n\nEfficient data mining, analysis, and processing are prerequisites for comprehensive analysis of system operation conditions, which includes not only the safety of physical equipment, but also the overall changes caused by data anomalies. Therefore, the first step is to determine the specific characteristics of multi-source heterogeneous data and establish key data acquisition methods from two dimensions: logical reasoning and data mining. Using multi-modal [deep learning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/deep-learning \"Learn more about deep learning from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), the integration of multi-source heterogeneous data can be achieved. This overcomes the integration difficulties caused by data heterogeneity \\[[20](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#bib20)\\] and [sparsity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/sparsity \"Learn more about sparsity from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), highlights the complex fusion and analysis of heterogeneous data, and clarifies the mechanism of multi-source heterogeneous big data integration analysis.\n\n-   **3)**\n    \n    **Edge-cloud collaborative safe operation and maintenance knowledge generation on industrial internet.**\n    \n\nEdge-cloud collaboration technology can promote the development of intelligent operation and maintenance levels in production systems \\[[21](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#bib21)\\]. Establishing a unified, centralized, and elastic cloud base enables the centralized deployment, integration, and sharing of applications in production systems, and a standardized cloud operation and maintenance environment. Based on edge-cloud [collaborative computing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/computer-supported-cooperative-work \"Learn more about collaborative computing from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") technology, operation and maintenance knowledge production mechanisms can be supported in different scenarios. Deploying a unified, open, and standardized oil and gas data platform permits the establishment of a universal, open, and scalable intelligent and safe operation and maintenance platform. Based on perception, interconnection, and data fusion, it then becomes possible to establish an operation and maintenance knowledge generation mechanism for key processes, such as real-time monitoring, intelligent diagnosis, automatic disposal, and intelligent optimization of production.\n\n-   **4)**\n    \n    **Digital-twin inference and decision-making for operating and data integration of oil and gas production equipment.**\n    \n\nAt present, reasoning decisions based on device status are conducted separately and independently. The comprehensive use of equipment status, operational performance, and risk assessment techniques to formulate optimized maintenance decisions requires urgent consideration. Consequently, it is necessary to establish fault diagnosis, risk warning, and performance evaluation models based on the integration of equipment mechanisms and real-time data \\[[22](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#bib22)\\]. Digital-twin technology can automatically raise alerts about equipment faults and predict performance conditions. This enables the integrated operation and maintenance control of equipment functions, performance, and risks, and achieves closed-loop management of equipment throughout the entire lifecycle. By constructing a data-driven digital-twin failure model, it is possible to gradually expand the available dataset, achieve fault-tolerant, self-learning, and self-organizing parallel processing, and establish a digital-twin inference and decision-making mechanism that integrates mechanisms with data.\n\n## 3\\. Intelligent safe operation and maintenance technology for oil and gas production systems\n\nWe have established a six-stage intelligent safe operation and maintenance technology for oil and gas production systems ([Fig. 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#fig3)). Starting by solving practical problems, the system clarifies the core elements, realizes the main functions, and solves key tasks. Six key technologies are employed to support the construction of the system, allowing five main tasks to be achieved. The system has four analytical capabilities, including three core elements that complete two major directional changes and ultimately achieve a basic goal. From this, a bottom-up intelligent and safe operation and maintenance technology for oil and gas production systems is formed.\n\n![Fig. 3](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2352854023000347-gr3.jpg)\n\n1.

[Download : Download full-size image](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2352854023000347-gr3.jpg \"Download full-size image\")\n\nFig. 3. Intelligent safe operation and maintenance technology for oil and gas production system.\n\n### 3.1. Fundamental goal\n\nThe fundamental goal of intelligent safe operation and maintenance is to provide a solution for safety assurance, quality assurance, and efficiency improvement of the entire oil and gas production system. This is achieved through standardized, digitized, visualized, automated, and intelligent management methods. By developing a unified intelligent safe operation and maintenance platform, it is possible to realize unified monitoring and judgment, unified linkage and emergency response, and unified processing to enhance the level of operation and maintenance management.\n\n### 3.2. Major directional changes\n\nUsing industrial internet technology and artificial intelligence, an intelligent safe operation and maintenance system needs to complete the following two technological transformations: ① from sensory-based to data-based equipment condition identification; and ② from experience-based to knowledge-based decision-making. By shifting from manual production scheduling, diagnosis, inspection, and empirical judgment to automatic push, intelligent diagnosis, intelligent inspection, and intelligent analysis, the operation and maintenance efficiency and accuracy can be effectively enhanced.\n\n### 3.3. Core elements\n\nThe core elements of intelligent safe operation and maintenance technology are reflected in the following aspects: ① Data perception is similar to the five sensory functions of humans, that is, external information is obtained through sensing technology. ② The algorithm is equivalent to the human brain and can analyze and judge external information through mechanism models, data-driven models, and other technologies. ③ A software platform is equivalent to a human body, supporting the transformation of business applications towards a “modular, iterative” industrial application model. The three are interrelated and mutually supportive, with the data perception as the foundation, algorithm patterns as the core, and software platforms as the carriers.\n\n### 3.4. Analytical capabilities\n\nThe four analysis capabilities of intelligent safe operation and maintenance include: ① Real-time monitoring: By using a multi-dimensional space-air-ground monitoring system, it is possible to comprehensively perceive the [operational risks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/operational-risk \"Learn more about operational risks from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of oil and gas production systems, visually analyze the operational status, and achieve data aggregation and statistical analysis. ② Diagnostic evaluation: By utilizing intelligent modeling methods such as big data and mechanism models, it is possible to comprehensively analyze factors that affect equipment operation status, economy, and reliability, and accurately diagnose and evaluate health and abnormal conditions. ③ Predictive warning: By analyzing the possibility and timing of future anomalies, early warnings can be issued to identify the type and location of anomalies. ④ Maintenance decisions: By analyzing big data on operations and maintenance, optimization decision-making methods can be established, scientific and reasonable maintenance decisions and emergency handling suggestions can be provided, and the level of intelligence in operations and maintenance can be enhanced.\n\n### 3.5. Primary tasks\n\nThe main tasks of intelligent safe operation and maintenance systems include: ① Equipment monitoring and maintenance. The normal and stable operation of equipment and facilities is crucial for oil and gas production, and intelligent safe operation and maintenance systems can provide technical support for the monitoring, warning, diagnosis, and evaluation of key equipment on the production site. ② Process safety warnings. Oil and gas production systems involve complex processes and have high safety requirements. An intelligent safe operation and maintenance system must have the ability to detect and independently handle abnormal events in the production process in a timely manner. ③ Risk assessment. The risks inherent to oil and gas production change dynamically. Multiple risk inferences require intelligent safe operation and maintenance systems to carry out key risk control and provide emergency response measures to minimize the possibility of accidents during the operation process. ④ Intelligent analysis and decision-making. Big data management, integration, and intelligent decision analysis should be realized through oil and gas production data detection and analysis, providing technical support for oil and gas production system operation and maintenance. ⑤ Self-operation and maintenance of the system. The operation and maintenance system should have the ability to withstand abnormal events through the process of determining, defending, attributing, and tuning its own safety threats.\n\n### 3.6. Key technologies\n\nCovering knowledge engineering, machine learning, edge computing, digital twins, big data, system development, and other key technologies, safety operation and maintenance provides basic technical support for the intrinsic safety, quality, and efficiency of oil and gas production systems. The implementation framework is based on the six key technologies shown in [Fig. 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#fig4). By fully leveraging the advantages of each key technology, the key elements of oil and gas production will be empowered, thereby achieving safety assurance, quality assurance, and efficiency improvements.\n\n![Fig. 4](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2352854023000347-gr4.jpg)\n\n1.

[Download : Download full-size image](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2352854023000347-gr4.jpg \"Download full-size image\")\n\nFig. 4. Framework diagram for intelligent safe operation and maintenance of oil and gas production systems.\n\nBig data technology includes system informatization data processing, external cross-border data, and industrial internet-of-things data integration. The integration of data analysis, data science, and automation can be achieved using machine learning technology. Big data technology and machine learning technology can enhance the analytical and computational capabilities of digital-twin technology, which emphasizes the consistency of data sources throughout the entire lifecycle of the system. The accuracy of product descriptions is ensured by digital twin, thus providing technical support for the full lifecycle operation and maintenance of oil and gas production systems, and realizing full lifecycle operation monitoring. System development based on platform technologies such as microservice containerization and data middleware can be used to develop industrial intelligent application development frameworks, creating a flexible and open intelligent business environment. The advantages of knowledge engineering, such as high visualization, strong correlation analysis, and identification of hidden relationships, facilitate the analysis, reasoning, and decision-making on specific problems. Knowledge engineering technology can be used to form domain knowledge bases, while edge-computing technology can be used to provide convergent network, computing, and storage capacity. Finally, the application of intelligent safe operation and maintenance technology in oil and gas production systems can be realized in terms of real-time monitoring, early warning, risk assessment, and other functions.\n\n## 4\\. Typical application of intelligent safe operation and maintenance technology for oil and gas production\n\nThe close connection between the upstream, midstream, and downstream industrial chains means that oil and gas production has a distinct structure and transmission effect. Typical production scenarios include drilling and extraction, storage and transportation, and refining and [chemical engineering](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/chemical-engineering \"Learn more about chemical engineering from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") in the upstream, midstream, and downstream. Intelligent safe operation and maintenance technology can be used to achieve status monitoring, health management, risk assessment, visual management, intelligent warning, and risk prediction.\n\n### 4.1. Oil and gas drilling and production\n\nThe drilling and exploration of hydrocarbons in deep formations, deep water, and unconventional oil and gas resources involve complex processes and harsh working conditions. Oil and gas drilling and exploration operations are susceptible to multiple coupling accidents in harsh environments (e.g., high temperatures, high pressures, acidity, and open seas), posing great challenges for early warning and emergency rescue \\[[23](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#bib23)\\]. Through intelligent safe operation and maintenance technology, intelligent fitting of reservoir models and intelligent warning of oil and gas production safety can be achieved. This will improve the level of drilling and production technology, ensure the safety of oil and gas production systems, and help prevent accidents.\n\nBased on intelligent safe operation and maintenance technology, the collaborative construction of drilling and mining sites, ground/underground integration, and geological engineering integration can be carried out so as to improve the level of drilling, mining, operation, and maintenance. By developing an integrated intelligent safe operation and maintenance platform for oil and gas drilling and exploration, real-time and comprehensive perception can be achieved on oil and gas production sites, thereby transforming production and operation methods and minimizing operational costs and risks. By creating a virtual environment for drilling and development, it is possible to build comprehensive datasets and realize full connection of drilling and production data. This enables intelligent and safe operation and maintenance of oil and gas drilling and production scenarios based on multi-discipline, multi-dimensional, multi-temporal, real-time and complete global data. By utilizing intelligent safe operation and maintenance technology to establish a data analysis and intelligent diagnosis system, real-time data on vibration, temperature, pressure, flow rate, and other key equipment can be obtained. Through fault prediction analysis, it is possible to accurately determine the cause of a fault, study methods for identifying abnormal operating conditions in the oil and gas drilling and exploration process, and conduct safety evaluations of the extraction process. Thus, intelligent risk classification and control can be achieved, and potential problems can be identified in advance.\n\n### 4.2. Oil and gas storage and transportation\n\nIn the field of oil and gas storage and transportation, pipeline leakages are generally identified by monitoring changes in parameters such as pressure and flow rate. The leakage monitoring capabilities need to be improved. A lack of derivative disaster assessment models for oil and gas pipelines and stations means that the accuracy of risk assessment predictions is low. Systematic integrity evaluation methods are yet to be developed for the inspection and maintenance of storage tanks \\[[24](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#bib24)\\]. To solve these problems, intelligent safe operation and maintenance technologies are required. By formulating a reasonable operation and maintenance plan, simulating and analyzing the decision-making effect, and tracking and managing the decision-making implementation process, it is possible to reduce the decision-making risk, improve the macro decision analysis ability, achieve [predictive maintenance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/predictive-maintenance \"Learn more about predictive maintenance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), effectively cut maintenance costs, and minimize the risk of unplanned downtime.\n\nIntelligent safe operation and maintenance technology should make the oil and gas storage and transportation process safer in terms of process risk evolution, real-time risk perception, intelligent warning technology, and key facility health monitoring. To address the challenges of risk monitoring and early warning in the oil and gas storage and transportation process, a remote monitoring and predictive maintenance platform combining edge-cloud technology is required, integrating business data and spatial data. Based on perception, computation, and modeling, it is possible to achieve interactive mapping between physical and virtual spaces for intelligent applications. By fully utilizing monitoring data in actual production, intelligent safe operation and maintenance technology can analyze key hydraulic and thermal processes during oil and gas storage and transportation. The analysis of big data allows such a system to achieve rapid and accurate fault diagnosis, timely risk warning, and real-time process monitoring, as well as improving the safety of the entire process of oil and gas storage and transportation.\n\n### 4.3. Oil and gas refining and chemical engineering\n\nOil and [gas refining](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/natural-gas-processing \"Learn more about gas refining from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and chemical engineering suffers from resource dispersion and lack of coordination, partly because of the large production scale and complex processes of large refining enterprises. In addition, the refining process is complex, and operational control is difficult because of the involvement of flammable and explosive materials. Therefore, the safety problems associated with refining have gradually developed into a complex problem involving multiple media \\[[25](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#bib25)\\]. Conventional operation and maintenance technology not only improves the production efficiency and management efficiency of refining and chemical enterprises, but also introduces safety hazards.\n\nBy creating a real-time model of a refinery, intelligent safe operation and maintenance technology can provide dynamic alerts driven by virtual and real data synchronization. Personnel in the accident area can receive alerts and evacuation guidance, while initiating an accident response mechanism. To address the difficulty of risk warning for key refining equipment, digital-twin technology and big data can be combined to establish a digital-twin model for equipment. This enables dynamic warnings driven by virtual and real data synchronization. Based on real-time mapping and virtual sensing technology, complex fault diagnosis and tracing technology can address the problem of fault diagnosis and management faced by refining equipment, achieving virtual and real fusion diagnosis and early warning. To manage the health of refining equipment, a multi-source monitoring [data feature](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/datum-feature \"Learn more about data feature from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") indicator system can be established based on big data, exploring the implicit relationship between feature indicators and equipment deterioration status. Such a system could also construct an equipment health assessment scale and understand equipment health conditions in real time.\n\n## 5\\. Development trend of intelligent safe operation and maintenance technology\n\nAt present, the safety of oil and gas production systems includes not only the safety of physical equipment, but also changes in the comprehensive situation of the system caused by network attacks and data anomalies. The diversified characteristics of production safety risks increase the difficulty of identifying potential risks, and make the safety situation more severe. These technological and situational changes have led to the development of intelligent safe operation and maintenance towards intelligent decision-making, proactive prevention, and comprehensive information and physical safety.\n\n### 5.1. Development of safe operation and maintenance towards intelligent decision making\n\nIntelligent safe operation and maintenance can identify safety risks that may pose a threat to system safety, with big data technology used to analyze massive amounts of security data. However, there are issues with unclear safety risk elements and risk evolution mechanisms in the analysis of functional components or application layers of the system. Thus, there is no theoretical framework for describing the cross-domain risk transmission and evolution of oil and gas production systems. Intelligent safe operation and maintenance should develop towards intelligent perception, data chain utilization, and intelligent decision-making. By conducting logical and knowledge-based reasoning, difficult-to-measure physical quantities can be estimated, potential security threats can be predicted and judged, and the accurate warning and handling of security risks can be improved.\n\n### 5.2. Transition from risk monitoring to proactive prevention\n\nAbnormal operation of the oil and gas production system itself can lead to data anomalies. Therefore, accurately detecting system abnormal behavior and confirming the source is the key to active detection and defense. A lack of information updates has led to uncertainties and low accuracy levels in long-term forecasting. In intelligent safe operation and maintenance systems, the transformation from passive safety protection to proactive defense can be realized by establishing active prevention safety technology. By utilizing mixed perception information and risk prediction models, intelligent safety reasoning and decision-making techniques for oil and gas production systems can be implemented, risk factors can be identified, and different levels of risk factor system frameworks can be constructed. Elaborating on the basic forms of risk formation and evolution propagation enables comprehensive and effective diagnosis and accurate prediction of oil and gas production and operation.\n\n### 5.3. Evolution from system safety to comprehensive information physical safety\n\nThe information safety threat to oil and gas production information systems interacts with engineering safety risks to the physical system, creating a systemic comprehensive security problem. The unclear coupling mechanism and control factors mean that there is a lack of active defense and control techniques. Therefore, intelligent safe operation and maintenance should clarify the information–physical coupling mechanism, reveal the cross-domain risk evolution, and construct a perception/evaluation strategy. By establishing an [anomaly detection](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/anomaly-detection \"Learn more about anomaly detection from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and warning technique for oil and gas production systems under information–physical interactions, a theoretical and methodological system for risk analysis and control can be formed. This is of great significance in the development of intelligent safe operation and maintenance technology.\n\n## 6\\. Conclusions\n\nThere is an urgent need for the digital transformation of oil and gas production, operation, and maintenance. Thus, it is necessary to study the integration and application of new-generation information technologies in intelligent oil and gas safe production, establish intelligent safe operation and maintenance technology, and improve the level of intelligent safe operation and maintenance. These are the inevitable trends for improving the quality and efficiency of oil and gas production and promoting green transformation and development.\n\nKey technologies such as knowledge engineering, machine learning, edge computing, digital twin, big data, and system development can be combined to build an intelligent safe operation and maintenance technology for oil and gas production systems. Encouraging intelligent decision-making, proactive prevention, and comprehensive intelligent safe operation and maintenance will promote the digital upgrading of conventional oil and gas production systems, the development of digital and intelligent oil and gas production operation and maintenance methods, and build a new model of intelligent safe operation and maintenance.\n\nOil and gas production enterprises should vigorously develop intelligent and safe operation and maintenance, not only ensuring their own energy production and supply, but also effectively responding to international market competition. In a significant global economic recession and faced with the long-term instability of international oil prices, vigorously promoting the intelligent transformation of the oil and gas industry has prominent strategic and practical significance. Taking the intelligent and safe operation and maintenance of oil and gas production as a basis, relevant research can provide references for the intelligent development of the world's oil and gas industry, promote intelligent manufacturing services for industrial enterprises, and accelerate the digital and intelligent transformation of the manufacturing industry. This is of great significance in both economic and national security terms.\n\n## Funding\n\nThis research was supported by the Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China “Research on risk formation mechanism and control method of oil & gas storage and transportation system from the perspective of cyber-physics” (No.: [52234007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#gs1)).\n---\ncreated: 2023-09-21T15:52:02 (UTC +01:00)\ntags: []\nsource: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440\nauthor: Z.T.

While, ineffective control of ventilation and purification systems can result in increased energy consumption and cross-contamination. This paper is to develop intelligent operation, maintenance, and control systems by coupling intelligent ventilation and air purification systems (negative ion generators). Optimal deployment of sensors is determined by Fuzzy C-mean (FCM), based on which CO<sub>2</sub> concentration fields are rapidly predicted by combing the artificial neural network (ANN) and self-adaptive low-dimensional linear model (LLM). Negative oxygen ion and particle concentrations are simulated with different numbers of negative ion generators. Optimal ventilation rates and number of negative ion generators are decided. A visualization platform is established to display the effects of ventilation control, epidemic prevention, and pollutant removal. The rapid prediction error of LLM-based ANN for CO<sub>2</sub> concentration was below 10% compared with the simulation. Fast decision reduced CO<sub>2</sub> concentration below 1000 ppm, infection risk below 1.5%, and energy consumption by 27.4%. The largest removal efficiency was 81% when number of negative ion generators was 10. This work can promote intelligent operation, maintenance, and control systems considering infection prevention and energy sustainability.\n\n-   [Previous](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001312)\n-   [Next](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001294)\n\n## Keywords\n\nPublic building environment\n\nIntelligent operation, maintenance and control system\n\nVentilation\n\nAir purification\n\nInfection risk\n\nEnergy efficiency\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nWith the global urbanization, the building area is rapidly increasing, especially for public buildings ([Huang et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0018)). Enormous energy and resource consumption are accompanied by the rapid development of the building industry ([Su et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0041)). Building energy consumption has accounted for around 40% of global energy consumption, which has been the key to energy conservation and low-carbon development ([Chen et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0004)). The regulation of energy consumption in public buildings is conducive to the sustainable construction and development of urban cities ([Ma et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0025)). Public buildings can improve the building energy efficiency through operation, maintenance, and control of energy-intensive units, such as ventilation systems ([Gupta et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0016)). While, a major task of the ventilation system is to provide the adequate ventilation rates to dilute the indoor pollutants. If energy efficiency is improved at the expense of indoor environmental quality, it can potentially lead to a series of emergent incidents of building environment, such as transmission of infectious disease and transfer of outdoor pollutants (naturally/mechanically), which can seriously threaten the building occupants’ health and cause the incalculable loss ([Rohde et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0037)). Therefore, indoor environment improvement and energy conservation are both core objectives of operation, maintenance, and control system for public buildings. Particularly, global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses a challenge to the regulation of safe and healthy environment, and energy-saving building ([Ding et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0007)).\n\nThe essential task of developing operation, maintenance, and control system for public building environment is to reduce the pollutant concentration (e.g., CO<sub>2</sub>, particulate matter), infection risk, and energy consumption. Intelligent ventilation and air purification are both important to control the pollutant exposure level ([Feng et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0010); [Zhu et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0048)), which provide the key technologies for the operation, maintenance, and control of indoor environment.\n\n### 1.1. Intelligent ventilation system\n\nFor public buildings with the high density and mobility of people, indoor pollutants are generated by a number of sources (e.g., indoor occupants, furnishing and building material, cosmetic and cleaning products, and outdoor sources), which can present the non-uniform, dynamic, and complex distribution characteristics ([Feng et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0009)). Using the traditional ventilation systems with constant supply air parameters may result in the local accumulation of pollutants, cross-infection, and energy waste ([Ren et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0035)). To address these problems, intelligent control of building ventilation systems is significant based on non-uniform and dynamic pollutant distribution, namely intelligent ventilation system. Its essence is (i) _how to rapidly obtain indoor pollutant distributions,_ and (ii) _how to implement fast decision and intelligent control?_\n\nTraditional prediction methods for indoor environment such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) require a long computation time and cannot be used directly for online control. Using a number of monitoring sensors to obtain the non-uniform indoor environment is usually accompanied by data duplication and high costs ([Kumar et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0019)). It is urgent to develop rapid prediction models for non-uniform and dynamic distributions of pollutants, by using the scientific deployment strategy of limited monitoring sensors as input boundaries. [Ren and Cao (2019)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0036) incorporated monitoring techniques into the low-dimensional linear model (LLM) and artificial neural network (ANN) to predict pollutant concentration efficiently, and found that well-deployed sensors could provide the satisfying inputs for rapid prediction. [Cao et al. (2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0003) developed a systematic method of sensor deployment for efficient prediction of indoor environment using Fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering method. However, these studies did not apply the deployment strategy of limited sensors or rapid prediction models to real-life ventilation systems in buildings.\n\nThe decision of conventional ventilation systems commonly depends on a single-point or limited monitoring data for direct evaluation and control, which cannot effectively represent the non-uniform distribution of indoor pollutant, potentially leading to ineffective decision making ([Merema et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0026)). Thus, the aim of fast decision for ventilation systems should be implementing the scientific evaluation and control (combined with controller) based on the rapid prediction of pollutant distribution, to effectively reduce pollutant exposure level and infection risk, and also minimize energy consumption. [Ren and Cao (2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0032) developed a faster-than-real-time prediction model (low-dimensional linear ventilation model, LLVM) to predict the non-uniform pollutant concentration fields, and evaluated the ventilation performance with energy efficiency and pollutant level reduced by 43% and 28% after the decision when compared with that before the decision, respectively. However, no earlier studies have synthetically considered the feasibility of fast decision and control systems (strategies) in real building application.\n\nGenerally, intelligent ventilation system should consist of “limited monitoring system”, “rapid prediction model”, and “fast decision making”. Therefore, it is of necessity to explore the application of intelligent ventilation system to the actual public building environment.\n\n### 1.2. Air purification system\n\nRegarding the air purification system, air filters or ultraviolet (UV) lamps are usually used to remove indoor pollutant ([Feng et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0011)). High efficiency particulate air filter (HEPA) can approach to about 100% of removal efficiency for particles, yet some shortcomings still be found. (1) The accumulation of particles can result in high pressure drop, which would increase the energy consumption and replacement costs for fiber filters ([Li et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0021)). (2) Bacteria and viruses can multiply in fiber filter with the re-atomization and bio-release potential, which can cause secondary contamination and health risk ([Nakpan et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0027)). UV lamps have the function of disinfection to inactivate pollutants such as bacteria and viruses. However, UV lamps almost have no purification ability to remove the particles ([Fischer et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0012)). Moreover, air filters and UV lamps are ineffective against the pollutants that settle on walls, and are usually applied to indoor microenvironments ([D'Orazio & D'Alessandro, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0008)). To this end, portable air purification system, such as negative ion generator, is developed for effective removal of indoor pollutants (especially particles).\n\nThe negative ion generator can release a large number of negative oxygen ions through carbon fiber electrode ([Pushpawela et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0030)). Negative oxygen ions can electrically charge the particles, causing them to either repel each other or remove them by a deposition process ([Pushpawela et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0030)). Considering the spatial accessibility of negative oxygen ions, negative ion generators could effectively remove the pollutants from indoor air and indoor environment surfaces. [Pushpawela et al. (2017)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0030) measured the efficiency of a negative ion generator in removing ultrafine particles from an indoor chamber, and found that 70% of particles were removed within 15 min. [Grabarczyk (2001)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0015) used ionizers in an unventilated and unoccupied room, and found that the particle concentrations reduced by up to two orders of magnitude after 2 h for the particles in the size range of 0.3–2.5 μm. However, the major drawback of negative ion generators is the potential harmful effect on building occupant's health ([Ren et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0034)). Generally, it is suggested to use negative ion generators without the appearance of occupants, considering their side effects on health ([Ren et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0034)).\n\nIn buildings, the air purification system's layout strategy (e.g., location and number) has been optimally designed to efficiently remove indoor pollutants. For example, [Yu et al. (2017)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0044) analyzed the pollutant concentration after installing air purification device, and evaluated their optimal locations. [Shiue et al. (2011)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0040) evaluated the particle removal efficiencies at different installation heights of negative ion generator in a closed room, showing the maximum particle removal efficiency at the installation height of 60 cm from the floor. Most studies considered the effect of independently using the air purification system, yet usually ignored the impact of indoor ventilation on the air purification efficiency. For public buildings, investigating the coupling performance of intelligent ventilation and air purification systems is beneficial to operation, maintenance, and control for safe and healthy environments, and energy-efficient building.\n\n### 1.3. Research framework\n\nThis study aims to develop the integrated and intelligent operation, maintenance, and control system for safe and healthy indoor environment, and energy efficient public buildings, through coupling intelligent ventilation and air purification system. This work systematically integrates the limited monitoring technology, rapid prediction model, and fast decision making into a real building scenario.\n\nThe research framework is presented in [Fig. 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#fig0001). First, different layout strategies (different numbers and locations) of monitoring sensors are determined, and the experiment is performed to validate the simulation model. Second, rapid prediction of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration fields is achieved and validated by CFD simulation, based on which the optimal deployment of sensors is evaluated. Third, the optimal supply air velocity and the number of negative ion generators are evaluated by using fast decision. Fourth, online regulation of intelligent ventilation and air purification system is achieved based on optimal evaluation, and a visualization platform of intelligent operation, maintenance, and control system is constructed to show the actual implementation effectiveness.\n\n![Fig 1](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2210670723001440-gr1.jpg)\n\n1.

(For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)\n\n## 2\\. Materials and methods\n\nThis study uses a numerical simulation method to model the velocity, pollutant concentration fields, and distributions of negative oxygen ions. For intelligent ventilation system, online monitoring and experiment are first carried out. Fuzzy C-means (FCM) is used to determine the deployment strategy of limited sensors. The rapid prediction models, including low-dimensional linear model (LLM) and artificial neural network (ANN, using limited monitoring data as inputs), are used to predict the non-uniform pollutant concentration fields rapidly. The fast decisions for optimal supply air velocity are proposed by evaluating the ventilation performance based on analytic hierarchy process (AHP). For air purification system, different layout strategies of negative ion generators are defined, and the fast decision based on the removal efficiency is proposed for optimal number of negative ion generators. The framework of intelligent operation, maintenance, and control system is finally developed.\n\n### 2.1. Building model setup\n\nThe front hall of the International Convention and Exhibition Center (a public building) in Nanjing is selected for the intelligent operation, maintenance, and control of indoor environment. [Fig. 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#fig0002) shows the photo and geometry of the front hall, with a floor area of 292 m<sup>2</sup> and a height of 15 m. The hall is equipped with a variable air volume system for the intelligent ventilation, with an outdoor air volume (OAV) accounting for 32% of the total flow rate. The intelligent ventilation system is mainly used to control indoor pollutant level (e.g., CO<sub>2</sub>). The ventilation mode is mixing ventilation (MV) with nine circular supply air inlets and one louvered return air outlet placed in the ceiling. The radius of an inlet is 0.2 m, and the size of an outlet is 2.00 m × 0.96 m. The number of people (_N<sub>p</sub>_) to be accommodated in the hall is between 0 and 100. According to an OAV of 30 m<sup>3</sup>/h per person ([GB50736-2012, 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0014)), the maximum supply air volume is set as 9300 m<sup>3</sup>/h, with an inlet velocity (_V<sub>in</sub>_) corresponding to 2.3 m/s. The _V<sub>in</sub>_ values of 0.7 and 1.5 m/s are also considered, and the supply air temperature is constant at 24 °C (summer condition).\n\n![Fig 2](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2210670723001440-gr2.jpg)\n\n1.

(a) Photo and (b) geometry of the front hall in the International Convention and Exhibition Center. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)\n\nThe air purification system in the front hall is used to enhance the removal effects of pollutants (i.e., particles), and it is further combined with intelligent ventilation system. In this study, negative ion generator (KT03-A01) is applied to remove particles, with the size of 98 mm (length) × 72 mm (width) × 225 mm (height). A number of negative ion generators are arranged along the walls with a height of 0.5 m from the floor. The setup of negative ion generator is detailed in [Section 2.4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#sec0012).\n\n### 2.2. Numerical simulation\n\nCFD is used to simulate the airflow and distribution of pollutants (e.g., CO<sub>2</sub> and particles), to illustrate the effectiveness of integrated intelligent ventilation and air purification systems. All simulations are performed at steady-state assuming incompressible using ANSYS FLUENT 16.0. The Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) method is used, and the _Re_\\-Normalization Group (RNG) k-ε model is used for the turbulence modeling because of its great performance of airflow simulation ([Ren et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0033)). Based on the airflow simulation, the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration is simulated by the species transport equation.(1)$<math><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">∇</mi><mrow is=\"true\"><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">(</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">ρ</mi><mi mathvariant=\"bold-italic\" is=\"true\">u</mi><mi is=\"true\">C</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">)</mo></mrow><mo linebreak=\"goodbreak\" is=\"true\">=</mo><mi is=\"true\">∇</mi><mrow is=\"true\"><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">[</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">ρ</mi><mrow is=\"true\"><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">(</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">D</mi><mo linebreak=\"badbreak\" is=\"true\">+</mo><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">υ</mi><mi is=\"true\">C</mi></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">)</mo></mrow><mi is=\"true\">∇</mi><mi is=\"true\">C</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">]</mo></mrow><mo linebreak=\"goodbreak\" is=\"true\">+</mo><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">S</mi><mi is=\"true\">C</mi></msub></mrow></math>$where, _C_ is the species concentration for CO<sub>2</sub> (ppm); _ρ_ is the density (kg/m<sup>3</sup>); **_u_** is the velocity (m/s); _D_ is the diffusion coefficient (m<sup>2</sup>/s); $<math><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">υ</mi><mi is=\"true\">C</mi></msub></math>$ is the turbulent diffusion coefficient (m<sup>2</sup>/s); and _S<sub>C</sub>_ is the source term. For particulate pollutant, fine particles (i.e., PM<sub>2.5</sub>, typical particle size existing in indoor environment) are considered in this study. Considering that modeling particles as gaseous pollutants (continuous phase) is acceptable when the particle diameter is below 3.5 μm according to [Ai and Melikov (2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0001)), the particle concentration is simulated using a user-defined scalar (UDS) function by solving the species transport equation based on the airflow simulation, shown in [Eq. (2)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#eqn0002). The simulations of CO<sub>2</sub> and particle are assumed decoupled in this study.(2)$<math><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">∇</mi><mrow is=\"true\"><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">[</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><mrow is=\"true\"><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">(</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><mi mathvariant=\"bold-italic\" is=\"true\">u</mi><mo linebreak=\"badbreak\" is=\"true\">+</mo><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">u</mi><mi is=\"true\">s</mi></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">)</mo></mrow><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">C</mi><mi is=\"true\">P</mi></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">]</mo></mrow><mo linebreak=\"goodbreak\" is=\"true\">=</mo><mi is=\"true\">∇</mi><mrow is=\"true\"><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">[</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><mrow is=\"true\"><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">(</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">D</mi><mo linebreak=\"badbreak\" is=\"true\">+</mo><msub is=\"true\"><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">ε</mi></mrow><mi is=\"true\">p</mi></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">)</mo></mrow><mi is=\"true\">∇</mi><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">C</mi><mi is=\"true\">P</mi></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">]</mo></mrow><mo linebreak=\"goodbreak\" is=\"true\">−</mo><mi is=\"true\">A</mi><mi is=\"true\">n</mi><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">C</mi><mi is=\"true\">P</mi></msub></mrow></math>$where, _C<sub>p</sub>_ is the particle concentration (#/m<sup>3</sup>); _u<sub>s</sub>_ is the settling velocity of particles (m/s); _ε<sub>p</sub>_ is the particle eddy diffusivity (m<sup>2</sup>/s); _n_ is the number of negative oxygen ions (#/cm<sup>3</sup>); and _A_ is the removal coefficient of negative oxygen ions, which is equal to 1 × 10<sup>−7</sup> cm<sup>3</sup>/#. An oxygen ion is assumed to carry a negative charge. Potential and electrical fields are solved by Poisson and Gaussian equations, respectively. Negative oxygen ion is simulated by continuous phase model, as follows.(3)$<math><mrow is=\"true\"><mrow is=\"true\"><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">(</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><mi mathvariant=\"bold-italic\" is=\"true\">u</mi><mo linebreak=\"badbreak\" is=\"true\">+</mo><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">μ</mi><mi is=\"true\">i</mi></msub><mo is=\"true\">·</mo><mi is=\"true\">E</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">)</mo></mrow><mspace width=\"0.33em\" is=\"true\"></mspace><mi is=\"true\">∇</mi><mi is=\"true\">n</mi><mo linebreak=\"goodbreak\" is=\"true\">=</mo><mi is=\"true\">D</mi><msup is=\"true\"><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">∇</mi></mrow><mn is=\"true\">2</mn></msup><mi is=\"true\">n</mi></mrow></math>$where, _μ<sub>i</sub>_ is the negative oxygen ion mobility (m<sup>2</sup>/V·s); and _E_ is the electric field (V/m).\n\nIn CFD modeling, the supply inlets are defined as velocity-inlet with a uniform velocity profile, and the return outlet is set as outflow. The walls are defined as non-slip walls and insulated. In the CO<sub>2</sub> simulation, CO<sub>2</sub> release rate per person is 16.8 g/h ([Chow, 2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0005)), and _N<sub>p</sub>_ in the hall is defined as a constant of 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120. The CO<sub>2</sub> source is defined as a surface source (covering a surface area of 292 m<sup>2</sup>) located at a height of 1.7 m (the height of breathing plane). The CO<sub>2</sub> release is assumed uniform on this surface, with different CO<sub>2</sub> source densities corresponding to different values of _N<sub>p</sub>_. The CO<sub>2</sub> source is compiled by using user-defined function (UDF). In the simulation of particles, the total particle concentration (_C<sub>0</sub>_) at the inlets is defined as 11,000 #/cm<sup>3</sup> (measured by particle counter), and indoor particle concentrations are normalized by _C<sub>p</sub>_/_C<sub>0</sub>_. The modeling parameters of releasing negative oxygen ions from negative ion generators are described in [Section 2.4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#sec0012). Grid independence analysis is performed considering coarse, medium, and fine grids with the scenario of _V<sub>in</sub>_ = 0.7 m/s, and _N<sub>p</sub>_ = 20, which can be referred to [Section 3.2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#sec0018).\n\n### 2.3. Intelligent ventilation system\n\n#### 2.3.1. Online monitoring and experiment\n\nDeveloping intelligent ventilation needs the online monitoring of indoor environment to provide input boundaries for rapid prediction and fast decision. Considering the non-uniform distributions of indoor environment, a clustering algorithm of Fuzzy C-means (FCM) is applied to determine the deployment strategy of limited sensors, which can greatly improve the monitoring effectiveness, and reduce the monitoring cost (dependent on the number of sensors) ([Cao et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0003)).\n\nFCM is one of the widely applied and excellent unsupervised machine learning methods ([Cao et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0003)). It obtains the degrees of membership for each sample data to the cluster centers through optimizing the objective function, thus determining the category of sample data to automatically classify the sample set. In this study, a series of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration and velocity data (by considering different _V<sub>in</sub>_ and _N<sub>p</sub>_) are acquired by CFD simulation, and these data are normalized. The normalized concentration _C\\*_ and velocity _U\\*_ are clustered by minimizing the objective function ([Cao et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0003)). More details of FCM are shown in **Appendix A**. Next, cluster centers are defined as locations of sensors (potentially with the adjustment in engineering installation). The deployment of limited sensors in the front hall is shown in [Section 3.1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#sec0017) (with the number of sensors depending on the cluster number). The rapid prediction of non-uniform pollutant concentration fields can be achieved by inputting limited monitoring data. The optimal strategy (locations and number) is determined by comparing the rapid prediction errors under different layout strategies of sensors.\n\nThe sensors are also used for online monitoring of other environmental parameters, including temperature, velocity, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, total volatile organic compounds (TVOC), and relative humidity (RH). [Fig. 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#fig0003) displays the photo of a monitoring sensor, consisting of a particle sensor module (BITSHEEP PMS5003, ± 10%), a CO<sub>2</sub> sensor module (SenseAir S8, ± 3%), a velocity transducer (W410C2, ± 0.02 m/s), a TVOC sensor module (AMS IAQ-CORE C, ± 5%), a temperature and humidity sensor module (SENSIRION SHT20, ± 0.5 °C and ± 4% for RH), and a wireless transmission module (WH-LTE-7S1). TVOC is consisted of benzene series, organic chlorides, freon series, organic ketones, amines, alcohols, ethers, esters, acids and petroleum hydrocarbon compounds, which are usually emitted from chemicals, cleaning agents, building materials, and furnishings ([Zhang & Zhang, 2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0045)). Thus, particular attention should be paid on the determination of concentrations of TVOC. The online monitoring sensors can transmit the data to the web server by the LTE Cat-1 and GPRS networks, setting the interval of recording and transmitting the data as 30 min. By collecting the video data from the surveillance cameras in the hall and adopting the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm ([Wang et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0042)), real-time detection of _N<sub>p</sub>_ is achieved. The schematic of YOLO algorithm can be found in [Wang et al. (2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0042)).\n\n![Fig 3](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2210670723001440-gr3.jpg)\n\n1.

(For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)\n\nExperimental measurement is carried out using the monitoring sensors to verify the simulation model. Three _V<sub>in</sub>_ are considered in the experiment, and the measured parameters includes the velocity and CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. The measurement points are the locations of 3 monitoring sensors, shown in [Section 3.1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#sec0017). For _V<sub>in</sub>_, the measurement duration is 9 h, and _N<sub>p</sub>_ is recorded with the interval of 30 min. The inlet CO<sub>2</sub> (background) concentration is measured to be 400 ppm, which is used in the simulation.\n\n#### 2.3.2. Rapid prediction models\n\nRapid prediction models are used to predict the non-uniform distributions of indoor environment for fast decision and control of intelligent ventilation system. Low-dimensional linear model (LLM) is constructed for rapid prediction of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, including low-dimensional model (LM, reducing the data dimensionality and storage capacity of the database) and linear model (reducing the construction cost of the database) ([Ren & Cao, 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0031)). LM consists of uniform LM and self-adaptive non-uniform LM. Linear model is used to rapidly expand the database based on LM.\n\n[Fig. 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#fig0004) illustrates the schematic diagram for uniform LM and self-adaptive non-uniform LM. To reduce the system's dimensionality, “sub-layer division and recomposition” algorithm is proposed to determine the division point set _P<sub>d</sub>_ of _d_ (_d_ = X_,_ Y, and Z) direction \\[including one zero point, one full-length point, and (_N<sub>d</sub>_ −1) middle points; _N<sub>d</sub>_ is the division number of _d_ direction\\]. Details of LM steps are shown in **Appendix B**. The _N<sub>d</sub>_ in direction _d_ of non-uniform LM is same as that of uniform LM. In this study, the performance of two LMs is compared, and the calculation method for discretization error _ε_ is also defined, as shown in Eq. B5 in **Appendix B**.\n\n![Fig 4](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2210670723001440-gr4.jpg)\n\n1.

[Download : Download full-size image](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2210670723001440-gr4.jpg \"Download full-size image\")\n\nFig. 4. Schematic diagram of low-dimensional model (LM) consisting of uniform LM and self-adaptive non-uniform LM. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)\n\nThe linear model is used to superimpose linearly the scalar fields generated by any source within the steady-state airflow ([Ren & Cao, 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0031)). For example, when multiple pollutant sources exist in the room, indoor pollutant concentration fields generated by multiple sources are equal to the linear superpositions of those generated by a single source. Compared with the simulation, linear model can effectively reduce the database construction cost used for prediction, and improve the efficiency of rapid prediction. The discretization error _ε_ is also used to validate the LLM.\n\nBased on the LLM, artificial neural network (ANN) model with autonomous learning function is used to improve the rapid prediction effect of indoor environment, responding to limited monitoring data ([Zhang & You, 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0046)). In this study, radial basis function (RBF) network with better approximation and learning ability is applied to train and predict low-dimensional and non-uniform pollutant concentration fields. We construct a database for ANN training with monitored CO<sub>2</sub> concentration and velocity under different values of _V<sub>in</sub>_ and _N<sub>p</sub>_ as inputs, and the low-dimensional CO<sub>2</sub> concentration fields as outputs. Firstly, the output data in the initial database are derived from the cases with _V<sub>in</sub>_ of 0.7, 1.5, and 2.3 m/s and _N<sub>p</sub>_ of 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120, which are high-resolution data from CFD simulation. Then, the recomposition of low-dimensional database is obtained by LM. Finally, the database is expanded by the linear model to obtain the low-dimensional data with the scenarios of _V<sub>in</sub>_ = 0.7, 1.5, and 2.3 m/s, and _N<sub>p</sub>_ = 10, 30, 70, 90, and 110. After training the ANN, the simulation case with _V<sub>in</sub>_ = 0.7 m/s and _N<sub>p</sub>_ = 50 is applied to validate the rapid prediction model with monitoring data from different layouts of sensor as inputs. The prediction errors are calculated as follows to determine the optimal layout.(4)$<math><mrow is=\"true\"><mtext is=\"true\">MAPE</mtext><mo linebreak=\"goodbreak\" is=\"true\">=</mo><mfrac is=\"true\"><mrow is=\"true\"><msubsup is=\"true\"><mo is=\"true\">∑</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">S</mi><mo is=\"true\">=</mo><mn is=\"true\">1</mn></mrow><mi is=\"true\">N</mi></msubsup><msub is=\"true\"><mstyle mathvariant=\"normal\" is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">Ω</mi></mstyle><mi is=\"true\">S</mi></msub><mrow is=\"true\"><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">|</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">C</mi><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">C</mi><mi is=\"true\">F</mi><mi is=\"true\">D</mi><mo is=\"true\">−</mo><mi is=\"true\">L</mi><mi is=\"true\">L</mi><mi is=\"true\">M</mi><mo is=\"true\">,</mo><mi is=\"true\">S</mi></mrow></msub><mo is=\"true\">−</mo><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">C</mi><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">A</mi><mi is=\"true\">N</mi><mi is=\"true\">N</mi><mo is=\"true\">,</mo><mi is=\"true\">S</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">|</mo></mrow><mo is=\"true\">/</mo><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">C</mi><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">A</mi><mi is=\"true\">N</mi><mi is=\"true\">N</mi><mo is=\"true\">,</mo><mi is=\"true\">S</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><mi is=\"true\">N</mi></mfrac><mo linebreak=\"goodbreak\" is=\"true\">×</mo><mspace width=\"0.33em\" is=\"true\"></mspace><mn is=\"true\">100</mn><mo is=\"true\">%</mo></mrow></math>$where, MAPE is the mean absolute percentage error for rapid prediction model; $<math><msub is=\"true\"><mstyle mathvariant=\"normal\" is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">Ω</mi></mstyle><mi is=\"true\">S</mi></msub></math>$ is the volume of zone _S_; $<math><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">C</mi><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">C</mi><mi is=\"true\">F</mi><mi is=\"true\">D</mi><mo is=\"true\">−</mo><mi is=\"true\">L</mi><mi is=\"true\">L</mi><mi is=\"true\">M</mi><mo is=\"true\">,</mo><mi is=\"true\">S</mi></mrow></msub></math>$ represents the low-dimensional CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations by CFD-based LLM in zone _S_; $<math><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">C</mi><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">A</mi><mi is=\"true\">N</mi><mi is=\"true\">N</mi><mo is=\"true\">,</mo><mi is=\"true\">S</mi></mrow></msub></math>$ is the predicted CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in zone _S; S_ is the index of divided zone; and _N_ is the total number of zone _S_.\n\n#### 2.3.3. Fast decision for controlling ventilation system\n\nThe fast decision of intelligent ventilation systems aims to evaluate the ventilation performance, and then determine the optimal ventilation rate (or _V<sub>in</sub>_). The evaluation of ventilation performance is done in terms of indoor air quality (IAQ), epidemic prevention, and ventilation energy consumption. IAQ is evaluated by CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, which is an effective bio-proxy for indicating IAQ ([Lu et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0023)). Besides, CO<sub>2</sub> can be used as a good proxy for pathogen concentration and infection risk since it is co-exhaled with the aerosols containing pathogens by infectors ([Li & Cai, 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0020)), which is described in [Eq. (5)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#eqn0005). CO<sub>2</sub> monitoring inside enclosed environment is revealing to be a practical warning to prevent airborne transmission ([Palmisani et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0028)). Total IAQ is then evaluated comprehensively based on PM<sub>2.5</sub>, TVOC, temperature, and humidity, since that IAQ is also particularly relative to the determination of TVOC, PM<sub>2.5</sub> (related to outdoor infiltration and indoor particle resuspension), and other parameters such as temperature and relative humidity ([Paterson et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0029)). Through measuring the concentrations of TVOC and PM<sub>2.5</sub>, indoor health risks (such as asthma and other bronchial diseases) and the harmful impact of giving rise to irritant odors, causing the body immune level disorder, and affecting the central nervous system can be also forewarned ([Paterson et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0029)). For the epidemic prevention, prevention effect and infection risk are assessed based on the airborne pollutant level, and then to analyze the epidemic prevention level. Ventilation energy consumption is calculated based on the cooling loads. The fast decision of the optimal _V<sub>in</sub>_ is conducted by integrated evaluation of pollutant concentration, infection risk, and energy consumption.\n\nThis study focuses on the average CO<sub>2</sub> concentration $<math><mrow is=\"true\"><mo is=\"true\">〈</mo><mi is=\"true\">C</mi><mo is=\"true\">〉</mo></mrow></math>$ (ppm) in the breathing zone (_Z_ ≤ 1.7 m) as an evaluation index for IAQ. The criterion is defined as: “$<math><mrow is=\"true\"><mo is=\"true\">〈</mo><mi is=\"true\">C</mi><mo is=\"true\">〉</mo></mrow></math>$ ≤ 800 ppm” for “Excellent”, “800 ppm < $<math><mrow is=\"true\"><mo is=\"true\">〈</mo><mi is=\"true\">C</mi><mo is=\"true\">〉</mo></mrow></math>$ ≤ 1000 ppm” for “Good”, and “$<math><mrow is=\"true\"><mo is=\"true\">〈</mo><mi is=\"true\">C</mi><mo is=\"true\">〉</mo></mrow></math>$ > 1000 ppm” for “Poor” according to [GB/T18883-2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0013). CO<sub>2</sub> concentration limit of 1000 ppm is commonly recommended in different countries standards for the management of generic IAQ concerns ([Lu et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0024)). For total IAQ, the evaluation criteria for PM<sub>2.5</sub>, TVOC, temperature, and RH are displayed in [Table 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#tbl0001) according to [GB/T18883-2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0013). The threshold of PM<sub>2.5</sub> is 50 μg/m<sup>3</sup>, which is consistent with daily average limits of PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) ([Xue et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0043)). The threshold of TVOC is set 0.6 mg/m<sup>3</sup>, which almost corresponds to the limit of 0.5 mg/m<sup>3</sup> established in different IAQ indices such as Indoor Environment Index (IEI) in Taiwan, and Indoor Air Quality Certification (IAQC) proposed by Indoor Air Quality Management Group in Hong Kong ([Zhang et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0047)). The criteria for indoor temperature and RH are also within the comfort range proposed by the American Society of Heating Refrigerating and Air conditioning Engineer (ASHRAE) ([Alghamdi et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0002)). The evaluation results of total IAQ are given by calculating the percentage of at least “Good” among four parameters. Note that the evaluation criteria for (total) IAQ used in this work are more applicable in the studied building as shown in [Fig. 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#fig0002), which is located in Nanjing, China. The criteria can be adapted when intelligent ventilation control system is applied in other countries or regions. It is better to develop reliable values of criteria to improve the performance of intelligent ventilation control, which is discussed in [Section 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#sec0025).\n\nTable 1.

The prevention effect is assessed based on the changing rate of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration before and after the decision (through setting the optimal _V<sub>in</sub>_ after the decision).

Based on CO<sub>2</sub> concentration field and corresponding _V<sub>in</sub>_ and _N<sub>p</sub>_ conditions from the training database in the rapid prediction model, the samples _E<sub>cp</sub>_ are obtained, and a database of _E<sub>cp</sub>_ is constructed. During the fast decision, the real-time _V<sub>in</sub>_ from ventilation system, CO<sub>2</sub> concentration data from rapid prediction, and _N<sub>p</sub>_ from computer vision detection are used to calculate the real-time _E<sub>cp</sub>_. Then, the differences between the real-time _E<sub>cp</sub>_ and the samples are calculated to obtain the sample _E<sub>cp-sm</sub>_ with a smallest difference and the corresponding _N<sub>p</sub>_. Finally, with the same condition of _N<sub>p</sub>_, all samples _E<sub>cp</sub>_ are traversed to judge whether _E<sub>cp-sm</sub>_ is the minimum value: if _E<sub>cp-sm</sub>_ is minimum, the real-time _V<sub>in</sub>_ is the optimal one; if _E<sub>cp-sm</sub>_ is not minimum, _V<sub>in</sub>_ corresponding to the smallest _E<sub>cp</sub>_ is the optimal one. Optimal _V<sub>in</sub>_ by fast decision is further used for the control of ventilation system, ref., [Section 2.5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#sec0015).\n\n### 2.4.

The negative ion generators are placed at the height of 0.5 m, and the maximum number of 10 is considered. [Fig. 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#fig0005) shows the layout of negative ion generators in the hall. The distributions of negative oxygen ions and indoor particles are further compared under different numbers of negative ion generators (_N<sub>g</sub>_ = 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10).\n\nTable 2.

Fast decision for air purification system\n\nFast decision for air purification system is applied to improve the removal efficiency of particles. The optimal number of negative ion generators is determined by comparing the removal efficiencies under different layout strategies. Generally, two negative ion generators are turned on, and then the removal efficiency is calculated. If the removal efficiency is below 70% (the threshold assumed in this work) under two negative ion generators, the number should be increased, and the removal efficiency is further reevaluated. Removal efficiency _η_ (%) is calculated by the particle concentrations when negative ion generators are turned on and off.(8)$<math><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">η</mi><mo linebreak=\"goodbreak\" is=\"true\">=</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">[</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><mn is=\"true\">1</mn><mo linebreak=\"badbreak\" is=\"true\">−</mo><mfrac is=\"true\"><mrow is=\"true\"><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">C</mi><mi is=\"true\">p</mi></msub><mspace width=\"0.33em\" is=\"true\"></mspace><mrow is=\"true\"><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">(</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">o</mi><mi is=\"true\">n</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mrow is=\"true\"><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">C</mi><mi is=\"true\">p</mi></msub><mspace width=\"0.33em\" is=\"true\"></mspace><mrow is=\"true\"><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">(</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">o</mi><mi is=\"true\">f</mi><mi is=\"true\">f</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mfrac></mrow><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">]</mo></mrow><mo linebreak=\"goodbreak\" is=\"true\">×</mo><mspace width=\"0.33em\" is=\"true\"></mspace><mn is=\"true\">100</mn><mo is=\"true\">%</mo></mrow></math>$where, _C<sub>p</sub>_ (_on_) is the particle concentration (#/m<sup>3</sup>) when negative ion generators are turned on; and _C<sub>p</sub>_ (_off_) is the particle concentration (#/m<sup>3</sup>) when negative ion generators are turned off. The optimal number of negative ion generators by fast decision is further used to control air purification system.\n\n### 2.5. Operation, maintenance and control system\n\nBy combining limited monitoring modules, rapid prediction models and fast decision methods, the intelligent operation, maintenance, and control system for indoor environment is developed based on five subsystems, as shown in **Appendix C**. Intelligent ventilation system corresponds to subsystems 1, 2, 3 and 4, and air purification system corresponds to subsystem 5.\n\nThe visualization platform of intelligent operation, maintenance, and control system is built based on these subsystems (detailed in [Section 3.6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#sec0024)). Regarding the control units, the optimal _V<sub>in</sub>_ for intelligent ventilation system is regulated by the dampers, which are connected to the controller (PCF8591 driver module) to remotely receive the control commands on _V<sub>in</sub>_. Negative ion generators (the number) are controlled by remote power switch. Negative ion generators are turned on when the monitored PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration exceeds 50 μg/m<sup>3</sup> and the front hall is unoccupied (during 8:00–17:00), to reduce the potential harmful effect of negative ion generator. Then, optimal number of negative ion generators is evaluated by the fast decision for air purification system ([Section 2.4.2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#sec0014)).\n\n[Table 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#tbl0003) shows an overview of cases in this work. 18 cases are used for the FCM cluster analysis and training of the rapid prediction model. One case is utilized for the validation of rapid prediction model. 15 cases are applied to analyze the effect of negative ion generator on the air purification. The cases for grid independence analysis are not shown here.\n\nTable 3.

Results and discussion\n\nFirst, deployment strategies (number and location) of limited sensors were determined and analyzed. Then, simulations’ prediction was compared with the experiment, to validate the simulation model. Rapid prediction models were validated by the simulation. Optimal deployment of sensors was determined. The air purification effects based on negative oxygen ions and particles were analyzed with different numbers of negative ion generators. Optimal _V<sub>in</sub>_ and number of negative ion generators were evaluated, respectively, based on the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, infection risk, and ventilation energy consumption, and the removal efficiencies before and after the decision. The visualization platform was established.\n\n### 3.1. Deployment strategy of limited monitoring sensors\n\nIn this section, the cluster results by the FCM algorithm were analyzed in **Appendix D**. For different numbers of clusters (sensors), the coordinates of cluster centroids with _V<sub>in</sub>_ = 0.7 m/s were selected as the sensor locations. [Fig. 6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#fig0006) displays the deployment strategies for different numbers of sensors. The optimal deployment strategy of sensors was determined comparing prediction errors (with monitoring data from different number of sensors as inputs), as shown in [Section 3.3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#sec0019).\n\n![Fig 6](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2210670723001440-gr6.jpg)\n\n1.

Model validation\n\nThe simulation model's prediction was verified by the experiment, and the grid independence analysis was carried out among three different computational grids, namely coarse (1404,586 cells), medium (5233,965 cells), and fine (9490,272 cells), as shown in [Fig. 7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#fig0007). At the validation line (_X_ = 8.3 m, _Y_ = 11.9 m, and _Z_ = 0–15 m), the velocity profiles between medium and fine grids agreed well, showing that the medium grids were adequately resolved in the simulation cases.\n\n![Fig 7](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2210670723001440-gr7.jpg)\n\n1.

The experiment and simulation showed consistent results on the average velocity. Some differences were noted in average CO<sub>2</sub> concentration as _V<sub>in</sub>_ increased, and the largest difference was 6.8%. In the experiment, people may move in the front hall, which can potentially influence the validation accuracy.\n\n### 3.3. Verification of rapid prediction models using simulation model\n\n#### 3.3.1. Verification of low-dimensional linear model (LLM)\n\nThe recomposition performance of uniform and non-uniform LMs was compared based on sub-layer divisions of 6 × 6 × 6, 9 × 9 × 9, 12 × 12 × 12, and 15 × 15 × 15. [Fig. 8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#fig0008) illustrates the velocity fields and compares the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration fields from CFD simulation, uniform LM, and non-uniform LM under the scenario of _V<sub>in</sub>_ = 0.7 m/s and _N<sub>p</sub>_ = 20. The distribution trends of velocity and concentration were similar. With the increased sub-layer number, recomposition performance of LM was improved, which could better reflect the distribution characteristics of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration field. In this study, the recomposition performance of non-uniform LM was superior to that of uniform LM, especially when the sub-layer divisions were 12 × 12 × 12 and 15 × 15 × 15.\n\n![Fig 8](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2210670723001440-gr8.jpg)\n\n1.

The discretization error clearly decreased when the number of sub-layers increased. The error index of non-uniform LM outperformed uniform one, indicating its superiority in recomposition accuracy. Moreover, discretization error was analyzed when the sub-layer division was 11 × 11 × 11, which was about 1%−3% higher than 15%. When sub-layer was divided as 12 × 12 × 12, the error of non-uniform LM was below 15%, which can effectively recompose the database.\n\n![Fig 9](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2210670723001440-gr9.jpg)\n\n1.

The CO<sub>2</sub> concentration had a substantial increasing trend when _N<sub>p</sub>_ increased. The distribution characteristics of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration fields were similar under different scenarios of _N<sub>p</sub>_, because of the same _V<sub>in</sub>_ resulting in similar velocity fields. For different _N<sub>p</sub>_, non-uniform LLM greatly performed in recomposing the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration database when sub-layers were divided as 12 × 12 × 12. In [Table 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#tbl0004), the discretization errors of non-uniform LLM were calculated less than 15% compared with the simulation. Moreover, non-uniform LLM can reduce the construction cost of database by over 90% compared with the simulation (from hundreds of megabytes to hundreds of kilobytes), and improve the efficiency of rapid prediction.\n\n![Fig 10](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2210670723001440-gr10.jpg)\n\n1.

A superscript asterisk marked the monitoring zone where the sensors were located. The increased number of sensors improved the prediction performance. When the number of sensors was 3 or 4, the predicted CO<sub>2</sub> concentration fields from ANN were higher or lower than those obtained from CFD-based LLM. When the number of sensors was above 5, the rapid prediction results almost agreed with CFD results, indicating that five sensors could greatly enhance the rapid prediction efficiency.\n\n![Fig 11](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2210670723001440-gr11.jpg)\n\n1.

The threshold of 10% error was selected to judge whether the prediction performance was acceptable. When the number of sensors was 3, the average prediction error was between 15% and 20%, and the minimum error was larger than 10%. When the number of sensors was 4, the average prediction error was less than 10%, yet the maximum error was about 13%, making the ANN potentially ineffective in predicting the local CO<sub>2</sub> concentration field. As the number of sensors was more than five, the maximum prediction error was constantly below 10%, showing an acceptable prediction accuracy. Thus, the optimal number of sensors was determined as 5.\n\n![Fig 12](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2210670723001440-gr12.jpg)\n\n1.

The increased _V<sub>in</sub>_ can lead to the decreased negative oxygen ion concentration. While, increased number of negative ion generators can overcome the disadvantage caused by increased _V<sub>in</sub>_, and remarkedly enhanced the accessibility of negative ions, especially when the number of negative ion generators was above 6.\n\n![Fig 13](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2210670723001440-gr13.jpg)\n\n1.

The distribution of particles was dependent on the spatial concentration of negative oxygen ions. When the number was 2, particles were almost not removed. When the number was increased to 4 and 6, the average concentration at the breathing plane was reduced by around 19%. Furthermore, the concentration was largely reduced by 34% compared with the inlet concentration. When the number was more than 6, the air purification effect was largely improved, and the average concentration was reduced by about 61% compared with the inlet concentration. The increased _V<sub>in</sub>_ could result in increased particle concentrations, since particles were released from the inlets.\n\n![Fig 14](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2210670723001440-gr14.jpg)\n\n1.

(a) _N<sub>p</sub>_ and (b) _V<sub>in</sub>_ before the control and after the control (optimal _V<sub>in</sub>_ after the control) changing over time (from 8:00 to 17:00). (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)\n\n[Fig. 15](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#fig0015)(b) shows the variations of _V<sub>in</sub>_ before and after the decision (control). The _V<sub>in</sub>_ before the control was set as 0.7 m/s during 8:00–10:00 and 15:00–17:00, and 2.3 m/s during 10:30–14:30. The optimal _V<sub>in</sub>_ after the control was rapidly decided by the comprehensive evaluation index _E<sub>cp</sub>_ in [Eq. (7)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#eqn0007). The weightings for sub-indicators of pollutant concentration, infection risk and energy consumption were calculated by analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method ([Saaty, 1980](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0039)), which is detailed in **Appendix E**. The weightings were calculated as 0.31, 0.63, and 0.06 for pollutant concentration, infection risk, and ventilation energy consumption, respectively, and optimal _V<sub>in</sub>_ was obtained by traversing the database of _E<sub>cp</sub>_. Substantial differences were observed in the optimal _V<sub>in</sub>_ for different times. When _N<sub>p</sub>_ changed unpredictably, the fast decision of intelligent ventilation system can rapidly respond to the optimal _V<sub>in</sub>_, based on the online monitoring data of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration and velocity.\n\n[Fig. 16](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#fig0016) illustrates the online monitoring data of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration and velocity changing over time before (basic scenario) and after the control based on optimal layouts of sensors. When _V<sub>in</sub>_ was 0.7 m/s before the control, the monitored CO<sub>2</sub> concentration increased to above 1000 ppm, indicating the deterioration of IAQ. As _V<sub>in</sub>_ increased from 0.7 to 2.3 m/s, indoor air velocity increased about two times and CO<sub>2</sub> concentration decreased below 1000 ppm, indicating the improvement of IAQ. After the control, CO<sub>2</sub> concentration was consistently below 1000 ppm, and air velocity was below 0.3 m/s. Compared with the basic scenario before the control, fluctuations of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration and velocity were smaller after the control. The average CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the breathing zone before and after the control were rapidly predicted by inputting the monitored CO<sub>2</sub> concentration and velocity.\n\n![Fig 16](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2210670723001440-gr16.jpg)\n\n1.

The increased rate (%) of average CO<sub>2</sub> concentration changing over time was presented as well. During 8:00–10:00 and 15:00–17:00 with _V<sub>in</sub>_ of 0.7 m/s, the average CO<sub>2</sub> concentration before the control was mostly above 1000 ppm, and increased by 45% when compared with that after the control. During 10:30–14:30 with _V<sub>in</sub>_ of 2.3 m/s, the average concentration before the control was almost less than 1000 ppm and reduced by around 50% compared with that after the control. Generally, the average CO<sub>2</sub> concentration after the control based on optimal _V<sub>in</sub>_ was constantly less than 1000 ppm to satisfy the requirement of good IAQ, which proved the effectiveness of fast decision of optimal _V<sub>in</sub>_ in intelligent ventilation.\n\n![Fig 17](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2210670723001440-gr17.jpg)\n\n1.

[Fig. 18](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#fig0018)(a) shows the variation of infection risk over time before (basic scenario) and after the control. For the scenario of before the control, when _V<sub>in</sub>_ was lower, infection risk was higher than 1.5% limitation, indicating the poor epidemic prevention level. After the control, infection risk was constantly less than 1.5%, satisfying the requirement of good epidemic prevention. The variation of ventilation energy consumption over time before and after the control is presented in [Fig. 18](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#fig0018)(b). The ventilation energy consumption after the control largely decreased by 27.4% compared with that before the control. With the increased _V<sub>in</sub>_ after the control (compared with 0.7 m/s before the control), the energy consumption after the control was increased by about 25% when compared with that before the control, at the time moment of 9:30. Increased energy consumption was mainly utilized to reduce the pollutant concentration and control the infection risk, shown in [Figs. 17](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#fig0017) and [18](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#fig0018)(a). Therefore, the fast decision of intelligent ventilation could contribute to the favorable control effects.\n\n![Fig 18](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2210670723001440-gr18.jpg)\n\n1.

When negative ion generators were turned off, the particle concentration was assumed 11,000 #/cm<sup>3</sup>. Removal efficiency increased gradually with an increased number of negative ion generator. When the number was 2, the removal efficiency was the lowest by approaching to about 20%. When the number was ≥ 8, the maximum removal efficiency was 81.2%. Removal efficiency was reduced when _V<sub>in</sub>_ decreased. The limitation of 70% removal efficiency was assumed to determine the optimal number of negative ion generators. Thus, the optimal number was 6 when _V<sub>in</sub>_ was 0.7 m/s, and the optimal number was 8 when _V<sub>in</sub>_ was 1.5 and 2.3 m/s.\n\n![Fig 19](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2210670723001440-gr19.jpg)\n\n1.

The left column exhibited the control effect of intelligent ventilation, including energy efficiency, rapid prediction of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, and control effect of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. Regarding the column of energy efficiency, real-time ventilation load, ventilation rate, opening degree of damper, and energy saving rate were displayed. Non-uniform low-dimensional linear model (LLM)-based artificial neural network (ANN) can obtain the rapidly predicted CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations with limited monitoring data as inputs. For the control effect of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, average CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the breathing region (based on rapid prediction model), _N<sub>p</sub>_ (based on occupant detection), and IAQ (based on average CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the breathing area) were presented, respectively.\n\n![Fig 20](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2210670723001440-gr20.jpg)\n\n1.

Visualization platform of intelligent operation, maintenance and control for indoor environment in the front hall of the International Convention and Exhibition Center. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)\n\nThe right column displayed the epidemic prevention and removal effect, consisting of effect of epidemic prevention, distribution of removal efficiency, and total removal effect and total IAQ. The effect of epidemic prevention included prevention effect, infection risk, and epidemic prevention level. The distribution removal efficiency was displayed based on the distribution of negative oxygen ions and particles at the breathing plane of _Z_ = 1.7 m. The real-time monitored PM<sub>2.5</sub>, negative oxygen ion (the average value at the breathing plane), TVOC, temperature, and RH were shown in the column of total removal effect and total IAQ.\n\nThe middle column illustrated the fast decision results for removal efficiency, energy efficiency, epidemic prevention level, and IAQ, to emphasize the coupling performance of intelligent ventilation and air purification. Although the increased ventilation rate can lead to the decreased negative oxygen ion concentration, the increased number of air purification device also improved the pollutant removal effect. Generally, negative ion generators potentially reduce the pollutant concentration and infection risk combined with intelligent ventilation. In-depth coupling of intelligent ventilation and purification systems can be further considered in future work, to enhance the performance of intelligent operation, maintenance, and control of building environment. Moreover, the energy consumption of 10 negative ion generators was approximately 50 W, which was negligible compared with the ventilation energy consumption in summer conditions.\n\n## 4\\. Conclusions\n\nWith respect to the non-uniform distributions of public building environment, this study develops an intelligent operation, maintenance, and control system in the front hall of the International Convention and Exhibition Center, by coupling intelligent ventilation and air purification systems. The pollutant concentration fields are rapidly predicted using non-uniform low-dimensional linear model (LLM)-based artificial neural network (ANN) model, based on optimal deployment strategy of limited sensors. Optimal inlet velocity (_V<sub>in</sub>_) and number of negative ion generators are evaluated, respectively, through fast decision of ventilation and air purification performance. Ventilation and air purification systems are controlled in real time based on the evaluation results. Finally, a visualization platform of intelligent operation, maintenance, and control system is established to effectively display the effects for online monitoring, rapid prediction, fast decision, and dynamic control. The main conclusions are as follows.\n\n-   (1)\n    \n    Taking limited monitoring data from the optimal deployment of sensors (number of 5) as inputs, the prediction error of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration field by ANN model based on non-uniform LLM (sub-layer number of 12) was less than 10% compared with CFD simulation.\n    \n-   (2)\n    \n    Fast decision of intelligent ventilation can rapidly respond to the optimal _V<sub>in</sub>_, which largely improved the ventilation performance by reducing CO<sub>2</sub> concentration below 1000 ppm, infection risk below 1.5%, and ventilation energy consumption by 27.4%.\n    \n-   (3)\n    \n    Using the air purification system, the average particle concentration was largely reduced by 61% compared with the inlet concentration. By fast decision for air purification system, the maximum removal efficiency was 81.2% when the number of negative ion generators was 10.\n    \n-   (4)\n    \n    By establishing a visualization platform, the intelligent operation, maintenance, and control system showed the control effects of intelligent ventilation, epidemic prevention, pollutant removal, and energy savings efficiently, through coupling the intelligent ventilation and air purification systems.\n    \n\nThe limitations and future work are discussed. (i) This study develops the intelligent operation, maintenance, and control system (platform) of indoor environment in a front hall. However, the full-scale system for public building is not developed, and also the effects of intelligent ventilation control system are not verified by the experimental data, which should be the focus of future work. (ii) The coupling analysis between intelligent ventilation and air purification systems is considered, while the future work should also integrate the ventilation rate, infection risk, energy efficiency, removal effect, and IAQ deeply. Particularly, the mutual positive and negative influences between ventilation and air purification systems should be considered. (iii) There are still uncertainties about evaluation criteria of IAQ for intelligent ventilation control system, especially when applied in different countries or regions due to the potential limitations of different standards or recommendations. It can be favorable to establish the reliable values of criteria to improve the performance of intelligent ventilation control, which will be studied in future work. (iv) The real-time monitoring of occupant location and behavior should be also considered in the intelligent operation, maintenance, and control system to improve the prediction and control performance of dynamic building environment. (v) The intelligent operation, maintenance, and control system (platform) should be applied to more types of public buildings (e.g., hospitals, offices, and schools), and the diversification of indoor environmental parameters (including different pollutant types) should be also considered, in order to improve the integrated performance of operation, maintenance, and control.\n\n## Declaration of Competing Interest\n\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the supports from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. [52178069](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#gs00001)), and the National Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholar (Grant No. 52225005), and the Funds for International Cooperation and Exchange of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. [52211530036](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#gs00002)).\n\n## Data availability\n\n-   Data will be made available on request.\n    \n\n## References\n\n1.

A novel approach to system reliability analysis using DFTA, FMECA and BBN applied to 4 DGs has been conducted. The outcomes provide insight on faults and component [criticality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/criticality \"Learn more about criticality from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") to vessel maintenance and availability.

A framework based on outputs from DFTA [minimal cut set](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/minimal-cut-set \"Learn more about minimal cut set from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), RPN from FMECA were used as inputs for BBN to analyse ship marine DG system availability. A BBN influence diagram was used to build a maintenance strategy DSS. Overall outcome for the maintenance strategy selection DSS indicates relatively high unavailability. Therefore, DGs with low availability were recommended to be on Corrective action and ConMon, while DGs with good availability were recommended to be on PMS.\n\n-   [Previous](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001257)\n-   [Next](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001774)\n\n## Keywords\n\nSystem reliability\n\nMaintenance\n\nDynamic fault tree analysis\n\nBayesian belief network\n\nDecision support system\n\nMission critical component\n\nMarine systems\n\n## Nomenclature\n\nABS(NS)\n\nAmerican Bureau of Shipping (Nautical System)\n\nBBN\n\nBayesian Belief Network\n\nBE\n\nBasic Event\n\nBSI\n\n[British Standards Institution](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/british-standard-institution \"Learn more about British Standards Institution from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\")\n\nCBM\n\nCondition Based Maintenance\n\nCMMS\n\nComputerised Maintenance Management System\n\nCPT\n\nConditional Probability Table\n\nDFTA\n\nDynamic Fault Tree\n\nDG\n\nDiesel Generator\n\nDNV\n\nDet Norske Veritas\n\nDSS\n\nDecision Support System\n\nEMS\n\nEnterprise Management System\n\nETA\n\nEvent Tree Analysis\n\nFDEP\n\nFunctional Dependency\n\nFMEA\n\n[Failure Mode and Effect Analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/failure-mode-and-effect-analysis \"Learn more about Failure Mode and Effect Analysis from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\")\n\nFMECA\n\nFailure Mode Effect and Criticality Analysis\n\nFTA\n\nFault Tree Analysis\n\nIM\n\nImportance Measure\n\nIMO\n\n[International Maritime Organisation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/international-maritime-organisation \"Learn more about International Maritime Organisation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\")\n\nISM code\n\nInternational Safety Management\n\nLED\n\nLight-emitting diode\n\nMCS\n\nMinimal Cut Set\n\nMDT\n\nMean Down Time\n\nMRO\n\nMaintenance Repair and Overhaul\n\nMTTF\n\nMean Time to Failure\n\nNASA\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nNPRD\n\nNon-Electronic Reliability Data\n\nNSWC\n\nNaval Surface [Warfare](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/warfare \"Learn more about Warfare from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") Centre\n\nNUREG\n\nNuclear Regulatory Report\n\nOEM\n\nOriginal Equipment Manufacturer\n\nOPV\n\nOffshore Patrol Vessel\n\nOREDA\n\noffshore and Onshore Reliability Data\n\nPAND\n\nPriority- AND\n\nPMS\n\nPlanned Maintenance System\n\nRCM\n\nReliability Centred Maintenance\n\nSEQ\n\nSequence Enforcing\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nThe foundation of system reliability rests on two primary pillars, the first of which is intrinsic to the system's architecture and the second is obtained via maintenance strategy and execution. The capacity of the operator to effectively follow the maintenance plan set by an organisation helps to reduce failure and maintain the system's excellent operating condition between maintenance intervals. In this respect, the maintenance department's objective will be to use all available strategies to guarantee that failures are not only minimised, but also handled in an efficient and timely way. This might imply efficient maintenance, such as utilising the proper [lubricants](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/lubricating-oil \"Learn more about lubricants from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), changing filters when due or depending on their condition, and ensuring that spare parts inventory reflects component failure and replacement rate. Moreover, the International Safety Management (ISM) code provides guidance to all ship operators, and the document underlined the necessity for companies and ship operators to develop additional requirements to assist effective ship system maintenance ([IACS,2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib70)). In addition, it requires ship operators to identify equipment and technical systems whose sudden failure might lead to dangerous circumstances (IMO, 2018).\n\nThe existing maintenance strategy namely Corrective, Predictive, Preventive and Condition based maintenance are often selectively combined using reliability analysis procedures to come up with other hybrid maintenance strategies([Lazakis et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib43)). In particular, the wide application of Planned Maintenance System (PMS) and Reliability Centred Maintenance (RCM) in the industry can be attributed to adaptation of more than one maintenance approach to provide maintenance for entire systems ([Karatuğ and Arslanoğlu, 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib38)). In general maintenance guidelines for machinery and equipment forming a system are obtained from the [Original Equipment Manufacturers](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/original-equipment-manufacturer \"Learn more about Original Equipment Manufacturers from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") (OEM) Manual. Similarly, alternative elaborate maintenance procedures are equally provided by Classification societies through guidance notes which provides relevant options and information to operators who desire such services (ABS, 2016; IACS, 2021). Moreover, maintenance management systems such as Computerised Maintenance Management System (CMMS) that are stand-alone or come as a part of Enterprise Management System (EMS) are also provided by Classification Societies, Asset management companies, or the maintenance division of the organisation([Eriksen et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib27)). For instance, American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) and DNV-GL provides leading edge maintenance management system such as NS maintenance management and ship manager software respectively(ABS, 2016).\n\nOverall, there are multiple channels which ship operators can access [operation and maintenance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/operation-and-maintenance \"Learn more about operation and maintenance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") support except that most of this support being enterprise and generic in nature may not be as dynamic and responsive as the operator would want. Hence the need for researchers to provides solutions to both regulators and operators. Maintenance as defined by ([BS, 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib10)) is the combination of all technical, administrative and managerial actions during the life cycle of an item intended to retain it in, or restore it to, a state in which it can perform the required function. Therefore, by emphasising key phrases in the definition, \"retain\" and \"restore\"; refer to maintenance activities, while \"perform\" and \"function\" refer to the utility needed from the system or equipment. It follows that all maintenance procedures would be designed to guarantee that a system is available at all times within acceptable reliability limits. These limits are defined by factors which largely depends on the reliability inherent to the equipment and its usage. Other factors are to do with operators' environment, maintenance staff competencies, spare parts sourcing and maintenance strategy employed. In this regard the OREDA handbook provides a good reference on multiple equipment reliability analysis approach with acceptable generalisation regarding operating environment and equipment specific reliabilities ([Lazakis et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib43); [Marving Rausand and Arnljot, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib47)).\n\nIn this regard this paper will present the development of an advanced reliability analysis framework for marine systems operations and maintenance through application of reliability analysis tools for identifying maintenance critical components. The methodology also provides a maintenance decision support system for maintenance critical components on board ships. Considering this, the work is organised into parts, with Section [2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#sec2) providing a critical evaluation of system reliability analysis tools, Section [3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#sec3) presenting the innovative approach of this research, and Section [4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#sec4) discussing the case study application of the technique. Section [5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#sec5) presents Results and Discussion, while Section [6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#sec6) presents Conclusions and Recommendations for Future Research.\n\n## 2\\. Critical review on system reliability analysis\n\nSystem reliability analysis is central to the successful implementation of any maintenance strategy as it provides clear insight on machinery behaviour and the impacts of failure on availability of machineries up to system levels ([Ahn et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib2); [Bahoo et al., 2022a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib5); [Daya and Lazakis, 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib21)). Accordingly, reliability analysis tools are widely used to support maintenance strategy selection or implementation in line with organisational objectives. Therefore, various maintenance strategy such as Reliability Centred Maintenance, Risk based Maintenance, Total Productive Maintenance, Risk and Reliability Based Maintenance etc draw from existing maintenance approach using system reliability analysis to provide a tailored maintenance system([Cheliotis et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib13)). RCM developed in the aviation industry and [United States Navy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/united-states-navy \"Learn more about United States Navy from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") in the 1970s ([NAVSEA, 2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib51)) provides clear intersection on the combination of various maintenance strategy and used of reliability tools. For instance, the guidelines for the development and implementation of RCM by the Royal Navy and United States Navy considered the role of PMS and CBM as a requirement for achieving any RCM program(MoD, 2007; [NAVSEA, 2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib51)). While the nature of PMS stipulates time-based approach, that of CBM relies on sensor deployments hence the place of system reliability analysis to harness the weakness in both([Cicek and Celik, 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib16); [Cipollini et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib17); [Velasco-Gallego and Lazakis, 2022a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib65)). In general reliability analysis tools examine the effects and risk of failure by considering quantitative and qualitative aspects of machinery [maintenance and operations](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/operation-and-maintenance \"Learn more about maintenance and operations from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") data ([Karatuğ and Arslanoğlu, 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib38)).\n\nTo this end, various researchers have implemented the use of tools such as [FTA](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/fault-tree-analysis \"Learn more about FTA from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), ETA and RBD mostly combined to provide maintenance analysis approach in order to overcome issues such as [discretisation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/discretization \"Learn more about discretisation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), linguistic restriction, and expert judgment ([Duan and Zhou, 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib25); [Jun and Kim, 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib34); [Kampitsis and Panagiotidou, 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib37); [Khakzad et al., 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib39)). Research efforts by ([Konstantinos Dikis et al., 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib40); [Lazakis and Ölçer, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib41); [Lazakis et al., 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib42); [Velasco-Gallego and Lazakis, 2022a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib65)) implemented a risk and [reliability assessment methods](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/reliability-assessment-method \"Learn more about reliability assessment methods from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of FMECA and FTA as well as using Fuzzy [Multi Criteria Decision Making](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/multi-criteria-decision-making \"Learn more about Multi Criteria Decision Making from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") Approach (FCDMA) in order to identify critical components and provide maintenance decision support for ships with focus on equipment risk and [criticality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/criticality \"Learn more about criticality from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") to maintenance. Other tools such as Bayesian belief networks, Monte Carlo simulation, [Markov chains](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/markov-chain \"Learn more about Markov chains from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), [Petri Nets](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/petri-net \"Learn more about Petri Nets from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and Weibull analysis among others have been applied to model maintenance planning ([Kabir and Papadopoulos, 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib36); [Leimeister and Kolios, 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib44); [Melani et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib48)). On the other hand, complex system reliability analysis requiring inputs that are largely non-binary and continuous with stochastic failure behaviour would require different approach to address temporal system state or a repairable [mechanical system](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/mechanical-systems \"Learn more about mechanical system from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") that can operate satisfactorily at degraded condition. Recent research efforts have also focused on ship machinery real-time [anomaly detection](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/anomaly-detection \"Learn more about anomaly detection from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") for fault diagnosis ([Velasco-Gallego and Lazakis, 2022a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib65)); application of Bayesian and machine learning-based fault detection and diagnostics (Cheliotis et all, 2022); real-time data-driven missing data imputation evaluation for short-term sensor data of marine systems ([Velasco-Gallego and Lazakis, 2022a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib65)); and the development of a time series imaging approach for fault classification ([Velasco-Gallego and Lazakis, 2022b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib66)). Therefore, additional flexibility to produce a representative model taking all possible consideration will be required. Consequently, researchers have resorted to the use of multiple tools to accommodate system dependencies and complexities of multi system ([Marving Rausand and Arnljot, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib47); [Piadeh et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib54); [Velasco-Gallego and Lazakis, 2022a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib65), [2022b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib66)). This strategy enables the use of multiple data types for reliability analysis and the use of tools in a more flexible manner([Leimeister and Kolios, 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib44)). Accordingly, a critical review highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of the reliability tools used for this research will discussed.\n\n### 2.1. Fault tree analysis\n\nFault tree analysis (FTA) is a static method for analysing component faults in systems or equipment by identifying all possible causes of likely failures and impacts on the system through the logical analysis of dependencies in the basic events that lead to the undesired event, the top event of the fault tree([Lazakis et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib43){[NASA, 2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib49) #136)}. FTA is an important tool for reliability and risk analysis as it provides critical information used to prioritise the importance of the contributors to the undesired events([Relex et al., 2003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib55)). It utilises Boolean law by applying gates and events to describe faulty components and possible event(s) that could develop a fault. Therefore, FTA is an important tool for reliability and risk analysis as it provides critical information used to prioritise the importance of the contributors to the undesired event i.e fault or failure. However, it has some shortcomings to do with sequence dependencies, temporal order of occurrence and redundancies due to standby systems, consequently DFTA was developed to overcome these constraints in the static FT.\n\nThe dynamic gates which include Priority and gate (PAND), Sequence Enforcing gate (SEQ), Functional Dependency gate (FDEP), Spare gate (SPARE) and the spare event when added to the FTA structure becomes Dynamic FTA ([NASA, 2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib49)). In the PAND gate events are prioritised from left to right such that the left most event (fault) is considered first before the next; similarly, SEQ considers events in left to right fashion however rather than prioritising it enforces hence ensuring that events follow the expected failure mechanism([Kabir, 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib35)). On the other hand, the FDEP though evaluate events from left to right it does that considering the occurrence of primary, or causal event which is independent of other faults to the right([Kabir, 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib35)). The SPARE gate and event have unique attributes and functions; though events are evaluated from left to right as obtained in other gates, the dormancy factor feature of the spare event makes lot of difference. The dormancy factor is a measure of the ratio between failure and operational rate of the spare event in the standby mode ([NASA, 2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib49)). A cold spare has dormancy factor 0, a hot spare has dormancy factor 1 and a warm spare has a dormancy factor between 0 and 1([Relex et al., 2003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib55)). The application of dynamic gates and use of spare gates to analysis improvements in maintenance approach was presented in ([Lazakis et al., 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib42); [Kabir, 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib35) #437) both authors demonstrated how these dynamic gates can be applied to model time and sequence dependent failures.\n\nIn this regard, the dynamic gates in combination with other static gates provide a much robust yet simple structure compared to tools like Markov Chains and RBD. Therefore, DFTA is suitable for modelling complex systems failure behaviour with respect to sequence and dependencies, particularly where the temporal order of the occurrence of events is important to analysis([Chiacchio et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib15); [Jakkula et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib32); [NASA, 2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib49)). This is particularly important in order to account for the failure dynamics of static and dynamic system, while not disregarding the impact of environmental elements, temperature and other factors. The reliability of mechanical systems does not follow [constant failure rate](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/constant-failure-rate \"Learn more about constant failure rate from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") as obtained in [electrical systems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/electrical-system \"Learn more about electrical systems from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") such as semiconductor, LED and software([Relex et al., 2003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib55)). Reliability data bases for mechanical components such as OREDA, NUREG, NSWC, NPRD provide high quality failure rate information on various components and procedures for conducting reliability predictions ([Marving Rausand and Arnljot, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib47)). However, component failure rates for repairable mechanical systems are influenced by multiple factors and may not follow constant failure rates of generic distribution such as Weibull, Normal, [Lognormal](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/lognormal \"Learn more about Lognormal from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") the likes ([Anantharaman et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib3); [Scheu et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib59)). Hence, DFTA provides a platform that is capable for analysing reparable system while considering other factors such as dependencies and temporal behaviour or partially operating state analysis([Marko Cerpin, 2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib46); [Zhou et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib68)). Therefore, this makes it very relevant in analysing system improvements as presented in ([Daya A.A 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib20); [Turan et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib64)). Overall, these additional gates provided more scope in [DFT](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/density-functional-theory \"Learn more about DFT from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") analysis ([Kabir, 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib35); [Ruijters and Stoelinga, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib56)) which can be used to factor repair or improvements due to routine maintenance. Moreover, additional outputs such as reliability importance measures and [minimal cuts sets](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/minimal-cut-set \"Learn more about minimal cuts sets from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") in the DFTA are equally influenced by the logic structure of the model, meaning that the output of static FT and a dynamic FT analysis will be significantly different and reflective of the whatever dependencies exist in the model.\n\nThe DFTA provides additional outputs which are the reliability importance measures (IM) and minimal cut set. The IM provide a means to identify the most critical component/situation that contributes to the occurrence of the low/basic event leading up to equipment failure or top event occurrence ([Chen et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib14); [Kuzu and Senol, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib73) #768)}. Therefore assisting in identifying the event that, if improved, is most likely to produce significant improvement in equipment or system performance ([Relex et al., 2003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib55)). In retrospect the MCS provide insights on failure or fault development, in that MCS are the smallest set of basic events, which if they all occur will result in the top event occurring ([NASA, 2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib49)). Therefore, improving the MCS can greatly improve overall system reliability.\n\nSimilarly, the IM could provide vital information on components to the maintenance crew and ship owners prioritization of actions that could ensure equipment/system reliability through holding of right spares onboard or additional maintenance options. The main IM approaches are Birnbaum (Bir), Fussell-Vesely(F-V) and Criticality (Cri)([Lazakis et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib43)). The Bir IM evaluates the occurrence of the top events based on the probability of its occurring or not occurring, hence the higher the probability the higher the chances of top event occurring([Relex et al., 2003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib55)). Criticality (Cri) IM is calculated in a similar way to Bir IM except that it considers the probability in the occurrence of the basic event to the occurrences of the top event. The F-V calculation adopts an entirely different approach in that; it uses the minimal cut set summation i.e., the minimum number of basic events that contribute to the top event. Therefore, the F-V consider the contribution of the basic event to occurrence of the top event irrespective of how it contributes to the failure.\n\nMaintenance planning for complex system is dynamic and therefore constantly changing, the more reason why organisation adopts different maintenance strategy that could fit the [operational requirement](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/operational-requirement \"Learn more about operational requirement from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") or machinery condition ([Soliman, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib61){Heinz P. Bloch, 2006 #9)}. In this regard DFTA though a robust tool is not able to adequately address issues such as CCF, human error, natural events including subjective factors such as maintenance delays, spare part quality and skills shortages. Accordingly, to overcome some of these factors, DFTA has equally been combined with other tools to achieve additional research goals such as decision support or analysis requiring some level of subjective inputs ([Codetta-Raiteri and Portinale, 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib19); [Zhou et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib68)). Accordingly, DFTA is combine with other tools to improve quality and coverage of analysis such as machine learning based tools for diagnostics and prognosis analysis([Cheliotis et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib13); [Eriksen et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib27)) DFTA, FMECA and other tools([Daya A.A 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib20); [Karatuğ and Arslanoğlu, 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib38)). On the other hand, the constraints imposed by the DFTA structure and the deterministic nature of the input as well as the output makes it restrictive to model certain machinery failures. Overcoming this challenge in this research was done through the use of FMECA, as it provides the required robust framework to holistically analyse failures with all the dynamics involved.\n\n### 2.2. Failure mode effect and criticality analysis\n\nFailure Mode Effect and Criticality Analysis is an evaluation technique to determine the impact of failure or malfunction of system, equipment or components failures by evaluating and prioritising the effect of individual failures ([Daya and Lazakis, 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib21); [NASA, 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib50)). FMECA is composed of 2 analyses, FMEA and Criticality Analysis (CA)([Fu et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib28)). The FMEA is focused on how equipment and system have failed or may fail to perform their function and the effects of these failures, to identify any required corrective actions for implementation to eliminate or minimize the likelihood of severity of failure. While criticality analysis is done to enable prioritization of the failure modes for potential corrective action([Astrom, 2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib4); [Ceylan et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib12)). FMECA is a widely used tool for reliability, criticality and risk analysis across industry and academia, as it does not require much technical knowledge but provides good insight into system failures or malfunction ([DoD, 1989](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib23); [Marving Rausand and Arnljot, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib47)). [Cicek and Celik (2013)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib16) presented an approach for identifying and controlling potential failure or operational errors that trigger [crankcase](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/crankcases \"Learn more about crankcase from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") explosion using FMECA. In ([Lazakis et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib43)) FMEA was used for defect analysis on ship main propulsion engine by identifying critical engine failures for maintenance decision making. FMEA can equally be modified for specific application as presented in ([Niculita et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib52); [Shafiee et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib60)) where a modified Ageing Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (AFMEA) and Functional Failure Mode Effects and Criticality Analysis (FFMECA) was done for the techno-economic life extension analysis of [offshore structure](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/offshore-structure \"Learn more about offshore structure from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and ship systems respectively.\n\nFMECA is a major component used for system analysis of important maintenance concepts such as RCM and PMS as it presents a clear view of equipment, component and personnel interaction and how risk and reliability issues can be mitigated. Mechanical system component failure analysis with FMECA is generally robust particularly in establishing modes of failure and efforts to mitigate or prevent them, however is not practically possible to determine the probability of occurrence for each identified failure rate ([NSWC, 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib53)). In this regard, is common to see FMECA being used alongside other tools for system reliability study ([DoD, 2005](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib24); [Melani et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib48)). This is more so, as the analysis depends on qualitative inputs that can be influenced by the experience or sentiments of respondents, hence subjective([Lazakis and Ölçer, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib41)). Overall, the limitation due to the subjectivity and interpretation of results can be addressed by ranking; using weights, fuzzy methods or hierarchical approach such AHP ([Lazakis and Ölçer, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib41); [Saaty, 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib57)). Accordingly, this paper has adopted the use of FMECA for system reliability analysis in order to account for expert knowledge in failure and mission critical component analysis. FMECA also help capture some subjective operator sentiments which could agree or disagree with reliability results obtained from objective methodologies such as FTA([Marving Rausand and Arnljot, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib47); [NASA, 2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib49)). Accordingly, to address the challenge of interpretation and subjectivity in FMECA analysis a weighting method was introduced to account for experience and years in service of all respondents([Ceylan et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib12)). In doing these, issues of under scoring or over scoring certain failures due to inexperience or narrow judgement can be addressed, hence providing a balanced failure analysis.\n\n### 2.3. Bayesian belief networks\n\nBayesian Belief Networks (BBN) provides a good platform for [dependability](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/dependability \"Learn more about dependability from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") analysis, cause, effect and inferential analysis in a wide range of sectors covering health care, human reliability, machinery system reliability and decision support system ([Ahn et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib2); [BayesFusion, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib7); P. [Weber et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib67)). BBN are represented as direct acyclic graph (DAG) which consist of chance nodes (variables) representing possible outcomes of system states and a given set of arrows (connections) indicating dependability/relationships([Bahoo et al., 2022b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib6); [BayesFusion, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib7); [Canbulat et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib11)). The nodes takes variable inputs in [BBN analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/electric-network-analysis \"Learn more about BBN analysis from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") which can be continues or discreet and are not restricted to single top event, hence providing great flexibility unlike fault tress or RBD([Kabir and Papadopoulos, 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib36)). BBN can be used to represent cause and effect between parts of system or equipment by identifying potential causes of failure. Authors have used BBN for fault and diagnostic analysis as well decision support system (DSS), for instance [Jun and Kim (2017)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib34) presented a Bayesian based fault identification system for CBM by discretising continues parameters based on [maximum likelihood estimation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/maximum-likelihood-estimation \"Learn more about maximum likelihood estimation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") (MLE) to identify failure conditions; the research used the discretised feature as [binary inputs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/binary-input \"Learn more about binary inputs from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") for the BBN [conditional probability](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/conditional-probability \"Learn more about conditional probability from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") table (CPT). Similarly to address port energy efficiency towards the reduction ships emission during port calls a strategy using BBNs was presented in ([Canbulat et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib11)). This research also provides how BBN conditional probability can efficiently in-cooperate expert knowledge to provide vital inputs in decision making variables in areas where there is in adequate data or literature.\n\n[Bayesian updating](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/bayesian-updating \"Learn more about Bayesian updating from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") or inference provides bases for the use of influence diagrams in decisions analysis by computing the impact of new evidence to the probability of events and the influence on all related nodes([BayesFusion, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib7)). As such BN provide a good platform for DSS especially in maintenance strategy selection when considering several dependent and independent factors. Conducting system reliability and maintenance analysis demands in puts from multiple sources which the BN platform can accommodate as compared to other tools. Papers by [Jun and Kim (2017)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib34) and [Li et al. (2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib45) provide methodologies for the use of BBN in reliability analysis, however, while ([Jun and Kim, 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib34)) focused on fault diagnose ([Li et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib45)) emphases on [component reliability](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/component-reliability \"Learn more about component reliability from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") with limited analysis on factors affecting the reliability. Furthermore, BBN have been used to provide inferential analysis in conjunction with other tools such as Markov chain and Petri-nets especially in risk and reliability analysis ([Galagedarage Don and Khan, 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib30); [Kabir and Papadopoulos, 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib36); [Kampitsis and Panagiotidou, 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib37); [Khakzad et al., 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib39)). BBN based DSS are widely applied in maritime industry to handle operational issues such as [human factors](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/ergonomics \"Learn more about human factors from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and procedural issues such as maintenance ([Ahn and Kurt, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib1); [Kampitsis and Panagiotidou, 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib37)). Similarly in the field of ship system reliability analysis ([Velasco-Gallego and Lazakis, 2022b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib66))has presented on the use of BBN and FTA for ship machinery cooling system reliability analysis and DSS. Likewise, Bahoo et al. ([Bahoo et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib5)) applied a combination BBN and [Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/markov-chain-monte-carlo-simulation \"Learn more about Monte Carlo simulation Markov chains from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") to analyses machinery reliability estimation onboard autonomous ships to help maintenance planning and decision.\n\nMaintenance planning and decision marking for ship systems can be complex due to the operational nature, space constraint and onboard environment. Hence maintenance as well as spare parts holding must be carefully considered so that failures and repairs are adequately prioritised to avoid problems with onboard spare parts holding and technical skills mix. Therefore, notwithstanding the rigorous efforts by authors in the field of ship system reliability there exist some important gaps in the literature. Some of this includes, not clearly identifying component criticality to system availability, maintenance action prioritization to reflect failure severity as regard vessel operational demands and selecting maintenance decision to reflect operator's sentiment. Providing solution to these problems require a systematic approach to system reliability analysis. Accordingly, this paper presents a novel methodology, which involves the combination DFTA, FMECA and BBN reliability analysis tools to conduct component criticality analysis, system failure dependency and influence as well as decision support system.\n\nThe presented methodology provides a detailed and comprehensive analysis that identifies critical components in relation to ship availability and maintenance effort in an inclusive manner that can account for operator concerns, OEMs’ recommendations, and environmental influence. Unlike data driven approaches which rely on machinery health parameters or statistical methods such as distribution, [residual life](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/residual-life \"Learn more about residual life from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") estimation through [Mean Time To Failure](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/mean-time-to-failure \"Learn more about Mean Time To Failure from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") (MTTF) which depend on failure rates, hence are unable to provide detailed information on failure and their causes. Other graphical approaches such as the [bathtub curve](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/bathtub-curve \"Learn more about bathtub curve from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") also relies on [failure rate data](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/failure-rate-data \"Learn more about failure rate data from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), which is insufficient to identify issues such as single point failure, [common cause failures](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/common-cause-failure \"Learn more about common cause failures from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") or critical components within a system and its components. Moreover, machinery failures can occur due to material or design defects, age/wear out and poor maintenance or intrusively actual maintenance action. Therefore, a hybrid approach taking into account the multiple dynamics in system reliability and failure mechanics needs to be developed. Accordingly, to develop a ship reliability analysis alongside a maintenance decision support system these selected tools provide a good match and can accommodate all the relevant variables as compared to using one or a couple of these tools. Consequently, FMECA provides outputs for mission critical components based on operator perspective, MCS provides an objective output to reflect MRO data both of which were used to build DSS using BBN. Furthermore, a case study was conducted to demonstrate the suggested novel methodology.\n\n## 3\\. Methodology\n\nThe novel methodology presents a systematic combination of quantitative and qualitative reliability analysis approaches to ship system reliability by combining DFTA, FMECA, and BBN to address some observed gaps in the literature. This includes, for example, not explicitly defining component [criticality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/criticality \"Learn more about criticality from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") to system availability or prioritising maintenance actions based on the severity of failures in relation to vessel operating needs and operator-led maintenance planning. A methodical approach to system [dependability](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/dependability \"Learn more about dependability from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") analysis is necessary to provide solutions for these issues. Therefore, this research presents a unique technique for conducting component criticality analysis by utilising the particular strengths of combined reliability tools as presented in [Fig. 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#fig1).\n\n![Fig. 1](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0029801823001506-gr1.jpg)\n\n1.

[Download : Download full-size image](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0029801823001506-gr1.jpg \"Download full-size image\")\n\nFig. 1. Flowchart of novel methodology.\n\n### 3.1. Subjective inputs\n\nA key difficulty in maintenance planning is handling equipment defects that are not fully addressed in [OEM](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/original-equipment-manufacturer \"Learn more about OEM from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") maintenance and troubleshooting manuals, such as environment-related faults, design restrictions, incorrect application, or unsuitable operation. These sorts of defects typically result in frequent equipment failures and [performance deterioration](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/performance-deterioration \"Learn more about performance deterioration from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), reducing system reliability and overall platform availability. However, because these defects are not well documented by the OEM and may not have been routinely experienced by operators on that or similar equipment. It is thus difficult to capture for reliability and maintenance analysis. In this context, information from operators on problems and maintenance issues would be required, thus the use of FMECA in this research.\n\n#### 3.1.1. FMECA\n\nFMECA is widely applied in maintenance and risk analysis to provide clear understanding and procedure on what could go wrong, how it could go wrong, why it goes wrong, and how it can be corrected or addressed ([Marving Rausand and Arnljot, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib47)). The Criticality Analysis (CA) provides a means of identifying the events, occurrence or components that need more attention to avoid more serious or catastrophic situations([Melani et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib48)). FMECA is a bottom-up approach which provides a [systematic methodology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/systematic-methodology \"Learn more about systematic methodology from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") to gain deep insight on failures and their course on an equipment or system. Therefore, measuring criticality in FMECA helps to explicitly bring out the most critical component failure which can assist in maintenance actions and planning. In this regard subjective operator inputs were obtained using FMECA, the relevance of which can be described in 2 folds. The first is to evaluate operator sentiments and priorities specially to do with failures and maintenance challenges such as expertise and causes of extended [down times](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/downtime \"Learn more about down times from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). This was also used to establish maintenance critical failures and machinery parts. The second aspect was to validate critical components obtained using DFTA qualitative analysis. Therefore, to establish these 2 goals using FMECA analysis a questionnaire was produced and distributed using the Qualtrics survey software; [Table 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#tbl1) is a template of the FMECA table used.\n\nTable 1. Sample FMECA table.\n\n| Subsystem | Component | Function | Description of Failure | Effects of Failure | Safeguards | Criticality | Severity | Likelihood | RPN |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  | **Mode** | **Causes** | **Detection** | **Local** | **Global** | **Influence** | **TTR** | **Prevention** | **Mitigation** | **1–10** | **1–10** | **1–10** | **CxSxL** |\n|   \n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|   \n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|   \n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\nThe survey questions were aimed at identifying components that presents the greatest challenge to the conduct of maintenance onboard using [risk priority number](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/risk-priority-number \"Learn more about risk priority number from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). The RPN use 3 categorical variables namely identification, severity and likelihood usually measured in a linear scale based on increasing importance i.e 1 – 10. The scale used for the analysis is presented in [Table 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#tbl2), which shows the linear and Likert scale including colour codes representing respective scale values ([Jeong et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib33); [Tan et al., 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib62)).\n\nTable 2. Definition of Criteria.\n\n![](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0029801823001506-fx1.jpg)\n\nFurthermore, in this study, criticality was employed instead of [detectability](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/detectability \"Learn more about detectability from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") since enhanced sensor and monitoring have substantially increased the level at which problems are identified, either through set alarm levels or an emergency shutdown system. For the sake of clarity, criticality, determines the immediate impact of failure event to the equipment availability and functions. Therefore, a failure mode due to which the ship will not achieve one or more of the mission's targets and/or the safety of whole vessel is at risk until the failure is rectified([NASA, 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib50)). The next is Severity, severity assesses how the failure impacts on the operational availability of the equipment or system regarding normal operation and the duration it takes to be repaired or restored to normal operational levels. Severity is described as the worst potential consequence of the failure determined by the degree of injury, property damage or system damage that could occur. Lastly, likelihood and refers to the failure rate of the component including possibility and frequency of the fault occurring over a certain time frame ([DoD, 1980](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib22)).\n\nThe above explanation provides a guide to help respondents assess all the criteria against the candidate failures and components. Thereafter the responses were aggregated through a weight system to obtain single outcome to quantify the 3 criteria needed for calculating the RPN which are Criticality (C), Severity (S) and Likelihood (L). The RPN was used to get the mission criticality of the components or faults which is given by RPN = CxSxL scored on a scale 1–100; 1 being minor or low and 100 being very high score as regards impact. The FMECA was conducted through a survey completed by the engineering personnel of the organisation most of whom are either electrical or marine engineers with varied level of technical knowledge and experience. In this regard, a 2-weight system was introduced to account for experience and expertise, as presented in [Table 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#tbl3). Accordingly, all individual inputs were evaluated to reflect years of experience and specialisation of the respondents. For instance, response on piston failure by a marine engineer with 12 years’ experience will have more weight compared to that of electrical engineer with same experience and verse [vasa](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/vasa \"Learn more about vasa from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") if the response were to be on [alternator](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/alternator \"Learn more about alternator from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") parts.\n\nTable 3. FMECA Respondents and weights.\n\n| Experience | Weights | S | Weights | Ag Weight | Applied weight (%) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 0–5years | 50 | WKO/WKD | 0 | 50 + 0 | 0.5 |\n| 5–11 years | 60 | WKDWEO/MEO | 0 | 60 + 0 | 0.6 |\n| 11–15 years | 65 | WEO/MEO | 5 | 65 + 5 | 0.7 |\n| 15–20 years | 70 | FSWEO/FSMEO | 10 | 70 + 10 | 0.8 |\n| 20–24 years | 75 | FSMO/FSG CMDR | 15 | 75 + 15 | 0.9 |\n| 24–28 years | 80 | FSMO/FSG CMDR | 20 | 80 + 20 | 1 |\n| 28–35 years | 100 | FSG CMDR | 0 | 100 + 0 | 1 |\n\nAdopting the above weights, individual responses were evaluated according to experience and specialisation to obtain the population mean, equation [(1)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#fd1). Thereafter a weighted average is taken for each grouped experience, equation [(2)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#fd2), which provides single category for criticality analysis to obtain the RPN using equation [(3)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#fd3). However, the linear values used for the criteria were between |1–10| while the FMAEC RPN was 0 ≤RPN ≥300. In this regard equation [(4)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#fd4) was used to obtain normalised RPN within the range of |1–100|equation 1$<math><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">p</mi><mi is=\"true\">o</mi><mi is=\"true\">p</mi><mi is=\"true\">u</mi><mi is=\"true\">l</mi><mi is=\"true\">a</mi><mi is=\"true\">t</mi><mi is=\"true\">i</mi><mi is=\"true\">o</mi><mi is=\"true\">n</mi><mspace width=\"0.25em\" is=\"true\"></mspace><mi is=\"true\">m</mi><mi is=\"true\">e</mi><mi is=\"true\">a</mi><mi is=\"true\">n</mi><mspace width=\"0.25em\" is=\"true\"></mspace><mi is=\"true\">μ</mi><mo linebreak=\"badbreak\" is=\"true\">=</mo><mfrac is=\"true\"><mrow is=\"true\"><mo is=\"true\">∑</mo><mi is=\"true\">x</mi></mrow><mi is=\"true\">N</mi></mfrac></mrow></math>$equation 2$<math><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">W</mi><mi is=\"true\">e</mi><mi is=\"true\">i</mi><mi is=\"true\">g</mi><mi is=\"true\">h</mi><mi is=\"true\">t</mi><mi is=\"true\">e</mi><mi is=\"true\">d</mi><mspace width=\"0.25em\" is=\"true\"></mspace><mi is=\"true\">a</mi><mi is=\"true\">v</mi><mi is=\"true\">e</mi><mi is=\"true\">r</mi><mi is=\"true\">a</mi><mi is=\"true\">g</mi><mi is=\"true\">e</mi><mspace width=\"0.25em\" is=\"true\"></mspace><mi is=\"true\">w</mi><mo linebreak=\"badbreak\" is=\"true\">=</mo><mfrac is=\"true\"><mrow is=\"true\"><munderover is=\"true\"><mo is=\"true\">∑</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">i</mi><mo linebreak=\"badbreak\" is=\"true\">=</mo><mn is=\"true\">1</mn></mrow><mi is=\"true\">n</mi></munderover><mrow is=\"true\"><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">w</mi><mi is=\"true\">i</mi></msub><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">X</mi><mi is=\"true\">i</mi></msub></mrow></mrow><mrow is=\"true\"><munderover is=\"true\"><mo is=\"true\">∑</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">i</mi><mo linebreak=\"badbreak\" is=\"true\">=</mo><mn is=\"true\">1</mn></mrow><mi is=\"true\">n</mi></munderover><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">w</mi><mi is=\"true\">i</mi></msub></mrow></mfrac></mrow></math>$equation 3$<math><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">R</mi><mi is=\"true\">P</mi><mi is=\"true\">N</mi><mo linebreak=\"badbreak\" is=\"true\">=</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><munder is=\"true\"><mo is=\"true\">∑</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">i</mi><mo linebreak=\"badbreak\" is=\"true\">=</mo><mo linebreak=\"badbreak\" is=\"true\">≤</mo><mn is=\"true\">1</mn></mrow></munder><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">C</mi><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">w</mi><mi is=\"true\">i</mi></msub><mo is=\"true\">×</mo><msub is=\"true\"><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">S</mi><mi is=\"true\">w</mi></mrow><mi is=\"true\">i</mi></msub></mrow></mrow><mo linebreak=\"goodbreak\" is=\"true\">×</mo><mi is=\"true\">L</mi><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">w</mi><mi is=\"true\">i</mi></msub></mrow></math>$equation 4$<math><mrow is=\"true\"><msub is=\"true\"><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">R</mi><mi is=\"true\">P</mi><mi is=\"true\">N</mi></mrow><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">n</mi><mi is=\"true\">o</mi><mi is=\"true\">r</mi><mi is=\"true\">m</mi></mrow></msub><mo linebreak=\"badbreak\" is=\"true\">=</mo><mfrac is=\"true\"><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">X</mi><mo linebreak=\"badbreak\" is=\"true\">−</mo><mi mathvariant=\"italic\" is=\"true\">min</mi><mrow is=\"true\"><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">(</mo><mi is=\"true\">X</mi><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mrow is=\"true\"><mi mathvariant=\"italic\" is=\"true\">max</mi><mrow is=\"true\"><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">(</mo><mi is=\"true\">X</mi><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">)</mo></mrow><mo linebreak=\"badbreak\" is=\"true\">−</mo><mi mathvariant=\"italic\" is=\"true\">min</mi><mrow is=\"true\"><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">(</mo><mi is=\"true\">X</mi><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mfrac><mo linebreak=\"goodbreak\" is=\"true\">=</mo></mrow></math>$\n\n### 3.2. Objective inputs\n\nThe methodology adopted in this research draws from multiple data sources some of which are raw machinery log data, [maintenance and repair](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/repair-and-maintenance \"Learn more about maintenance and repair from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") data including technical reports, others are output from tools used in the research. This process enables a more robust analysis especially considering that the duration of the research will not allow verification or implementation of the methodology onboard. Accordingly, the objective inputs are independent numerical variables and not controlled by the modeler. These includes failure rates obtained from machinery failure data used as inputs for the DFTA, RPN values from FMECA, and MCS probabilities from the DFTA results used as inputs in the BBN. Furthermore, availability percentages from the BBN were used to build the DSS model which was complemented by MCS from the DFTA.\n\n#### 3.2.1. DFTA\n\nThe dynamic [fault tree analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/fault-tree-analysis \"Learn more about fault tree analysis from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") is an extension of standard fault tree analysis that provides for time or sequence dependent analysis and can also prioritise events for analysis. DFTA is selected for this study in order to utilise its system dependent relationship on the effect of component failures. The DFTA tool used for machinery/system reliability and availability analysis used input data generated from the operational records of 4 [diesel](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/diesel \"Learn more about diesel from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") generators for a ship [power generation system](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/power-generation-system \"Learn more about power generation system from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). Therefore, a DFTA structure representing the functional ship power generation system as well as the individual diesel generators was built. System reliability in DFTA involves generating a qualitative model of the fault tree usually from the [minimal cut sets](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/minimal-cut-set \"Learn more about minimal cut sets from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") on the [logic gate](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/logic-gate \"Learn more about logic gate from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of the fault tree. Thereafter, [quantitative analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/quantitative-measurement \"Learn more about quantitative analysis from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") using reliability and [maintainability](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/maintainability \"Learn more about maintainability from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") data such as failure rates/frequency, failure probability, [mean time to failure](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/mean-time-to-failure \"Learn more about mean time to failure from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") or repair rate can be used ([Relex et al., 2003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib55)), by calculating the unavailability and the unreliability of the system to be done.\n\nAccordingly, failure and maintenance data over a period of 6 calendar years obtained from the maintenance records was processed to generate components failure rates (⋌) based on equation [(5)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#fd5). The model structure was built using both static and dynamic FT gates and events to reflect the mode of failures and in other cases dependency and sequence. Therefore, top events and sub-events were modelled using dynamic gates while gates connecting to the main system were modelled using static FTs this procedure is necessary to reduce memory usage and improve calculation time. The probabilities for the static gates used were generally AND gate equation [(6)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#fd6), OR gate equation [(7)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#fd7) and Voting gate . Voting gate (equation [(8)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#fd8)) account for multiple connected components (_k out of n_) such as injection nozzles, cylinder blocks, fuel day tanks or supply line, this is because correct functioning of system requires all component but is not necessarily impaired due to a few faulty ones.equation 5$<math><mrow is=\"true\"><mo is=\"true\">⋌</mo><mo linebreak=\"badbreak\" is=\"true\">=</mo><mfrac is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">n</mi><mi is=\"true\">τ</mi></mfrac></mrow></math>$Where n is number of failures (10<sup>6</sup>) and $<math><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">τ</mi></mrow></math>$ is aggregated time in service of individual DG.

BBN\n\nBayesian belief networks provide efficient and flexible platform for the conduct of numerical analysis to aid decision making impacted by conflicting priorities. BBNs can be up dated with new data at any point during the analysis thereby providing a very efficient tool for decision support system especially for complex system maintenance analysis([Sakar et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib58)). [BBN analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/electric-network-analysis \"Learn more about BBN analysis from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") is conducted based on DAG structure consisting of nodes of various shapes representing events and their probabilities, connected to arrows indicating dependencies or influence. [Conditional probability](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/conditional-probability \"Learn more about Conditional probability from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") tables (CPT) of discrete or continues variables provide inputs for the nodes in the influence diagrams. The CPT can be updated according to data availability which provide the evidence (E) and event occurring. The evidence is used by the BN's inference engine to update the prior occurrence of event, equation [(13)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#fd13) ([F.V. Jensen, 2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib29)).equation 13$<math><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">P</mi><mrow is=\"true\"><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">(</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">U</mi><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">|</mo><mi is=\"true\">E</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">)</mo></mrow><mo linebreak=\"badbreak\" is=\"true\">=</mo><mfrac is=\"true\"><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">P</mi><mrow is=\"true\"><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">(</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">U</mi><mo is=\"true\">,</mo><mi is=\"true\">E</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">P</mi><mrow is=\"true\"><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">(</mo><mi is=\"true\">E</mi><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mfrac><mo linebreak=\"badbreak\" is=\"true\">=</mo><mfrac is=\"true\"><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">P</mi><mrow is=\"true\"><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">(</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">U</mi><mo is=\"true\">,</mo><mi is=\"true\">E</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mrow is=\"true\"><msub is=\"true\"><mo is=\"true\">∑</mo><mi is=\"true\">U</mi></msub><mi is=\"true\">P</mi><mrow is=\"true\"><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">(</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">U</mi><mo is=\"true\">,</mo><mi is=\"true\">E</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mfrac></mrow></math>$\n\nThe above equation represents the overall structure of the influence diagram for a BN structure analysis. In this case the conditional probabilities of failure are presented as parent event and faults are presented as children P (Failure│Fault event). In this regard the influence diagrams for the building the maintenance DSS was generated using the CPT output of BBN which provides the availability of the DGs. Overall, the parent/child relationship of the BN structure is derived from the Bayesian theorem and chain rule that enables the quantification of relationships among the variables. Hence the [joint probability distribution](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/joint-probability-distribution \"Learn more about joint probability distribution from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") _of P(U)_ represented by child(ren) _A_<sub><em>i</em></sub> for each node on the network can be evaluated based on equation [(14)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#fd14).equation 14$<math><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">P</mi><mrow is=\"true\"><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">(</mo><mi is=\"true\">U</mi><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">)</mo></mrow><mo linebreak=\"badbreak\" is=\"true\">=</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><munderover is=\"true\"><mo is=\"true\">∏</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">i</mi><mo linebreak=\"badbreak\" is=\"true\">=</mo><mn is=\"true\">1</mn></mrow><mi is=\"true\">n</mi></munderover><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">P</mi><mrow is=\"true\"><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">(</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">A</mi><mi is=\"true\">i</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">|</mo><mi is=\"true\">P</mi><mi is=\"true\">a</mi><mrow is=\"true\"><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">(</mo><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">A</mi><mi is=\"true\">i</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>$Where _Pa(A_<sub><em>i</em></sub>_)_ are the parents of _Ai in P(U)_ reflects the overall relation of the nodes in the network.\n\nAccordingly, the Bayesian network and influence diagram for the DSS were build using the Genie software ([BayesFusion, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib7)). Building the DSS require different approach as it requires utility inputs as value for decision choices. Therefore, first step in BBN analysis was to get sub-system availability using the MCS probability of occurrence obtained from the [DFT](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/density-functional-theory \"Learn more about DFT from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") analysis used as probabilities for the CPT of all the chance nodes. The BN chance nodes have 3 levels, first level identifies the probability of occurrence of the fault as a child of a component failure indicating either failed or not failed. The failure node represent components that are linked as child nodes to subsystem node which provides the output as either available or not available depending on probability of occurrence of MCS in CPT; [Fig. 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#fig2) presents a simple sketch of the BBN structure node relationships and options.\n\n![Fig. 2](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0029801823001506-gr2.jpg)\n\n1.

BBN structure node relationships and options.\n\nThe BN availability output together with the FMECA RPN provides vital inputs for the DSS in addition to maintenance strategy choices. The influence diagram for the maintenance decision support use additional nodes namely, decision and utility (value) nodes, each of which provides a complementary evaluation of the input variables. The decision nodes take in variable assigned by the [decision maker](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/decision-maker \"Learn more about decision maker from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") in order to model available decision variables ([BayesFusion, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib7)). In this case the decision variables are the maintenance strategy options in [Table 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#tbl4).The second node is the value node also called utility, this node provides a measure of the [desirability](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/desirability \"Learn more about desirability from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of the output of the decision process and quantified by the utility of each possible outcome of the [parent node](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/parent-node \"Learn more about parent node from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") ([BayesFusion, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib7)). The last node is the chance nodes which contain [random variables](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/random-variable-xi \"Learn more about random variables from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") representing uncertainties or probabilities that are relevant to the occurrence of the events([BayesFusion, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib7)). As explained earlier, they represent probabilities of MCS of the components of each sub-system as inputs in CPT. Therefore, these 3 nodes formed the methodology of the DSS which interpret the desired outcomes based on the available choices while; the value node takes in continues variables as a measure of the parent nodes (subcomponent) criticality. In this way the utility value nodes provide the expected utility of a parent node or top event feeding it to decision node to get its availability percentage; while the decision node in the influence diagram contains maintenance decision choices which are dependent on the RPN variables inputs in value nodes as shown [Table 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#tbl5).\n\nTable 4. Maintenance strategy options.\n\n| Maintenance Strategy | Definition | RPN Range |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Corrective Action | This is recommended for very high to high mission critical component or faults for example sea water supply pump impeller, fuel supply pump, automatic voltage regulator faults etc. | 75–100 |\n| Condition Monitoring | This strategy serves as intervention to ensure system availability targeted at component or failures whose early identification could avert major operational delays. | 55–75 |\n| Planned Maintenance System | The PMS maintenance choices prioritise time dependent component failures with no immediate impacts to availability repair requirements. | 35–55 |\n| Delay Action | Delay action maintenance choice is directed at those components with good resilience or sufficient redundancy such that there is little or no danger to personnel and system safety. | 0–35 |\n\nTable 5. DSS ranking scale.\n\n![](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0029801823001506-fx2.jpg)\n\nThe definition in [Table 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#tbl4) provide a general guidance in the maintenance selection process in the DSS and used in the decision nodes. Making the selection depend on 2 variables which include the RPN and availability. In this regard the normalised RPN factors down time, maintenance cost and lost utility due to failure have been accounted for; while the availability factors in component availability within operational period were equally addressed. Hence all the DGs are evaluated based on 2 main factors which are availability and system criticality based on RPN values as presented in [Table 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#tbl5).\n\n## 4\\. Case study\n\nThe [power generation system](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/power-generation-system \"Learn more about power generation system from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") provides the most vital utility on board ships which suggests the level of redundancy and design resilience usually provided by ship builders. These features are common for both merchant and [naval ships](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/warship \"Learn more about naval ships from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") though with significant high operational demand for the naval platforms. Failure of the [power generation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/power-generation \"Learn more about power generation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") system for naval platforms has several implications especially considering the number of personnel onboard, and vulnerability due to loss of weapons, surveillance and habitation platforms usage. The location and type of failure are important factors to be considered in maintenance planning due to logistics and OEM related concerns. In this regard the suggested case study implements a novel methodology through the combination of reliability analysis tools to address maintenance challnegs on the power generation plant onboard and offshore patrol vessel (OPV).\n\nAccordingly, data analysis for this research was designed to cover subjective and objective analysis. The subjective aspect of the case study provides intuitive guidance on model quality, while the objective part of the methodology provides numerical analysis using failure rates as inputs. The FMECA analysis presents experts judgement about failure and critical system component while the DFTA is a [quantitative analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/quantitative-measurement \"Learn more about quantitative analysis from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") on system [component reliability](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/component-reliability \"Learn more about component reliability from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). The inputs for the BN analysis were obtained from both failure rates and MCS output of the DFT analysis, while RPN numbers from FMECA analysis were used as bases for maintenance strategy selection of individual generators. Therefore, data used for the analysis includes FMECA conducted via online survey, failure rates using [maintenance and repair](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/repair-and-maintenance \"Learn more about maintenance and repair from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") data collected from 4 marine [diesel](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/diesel \"Learn more about diesel from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") generator plants, each rated at 400 kW and can be operated parallel or individual. This was followed by discussion about operation and maintenance process onboard including wider discussion to gain expert perception on maintenance process in the fleet.\n\n### 4.1. Subjective analysis\n\nFMECA analysis were conducted, for the marine DGs targeted at getting expert opinion on failures mechanism and how the DGs are impact by these failures. It also provides experts judgement on how this failure affect platform availability due to issues such as, spare parts availability, technical expertise, delays due to OEM and impact of the operational environment including practices. These outcomes from the FMECA were used to generate RPN number and normalised to obtain the mission critical component, [Table 6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#tbl6) shows respondents experience and assigned weights. The assign weights are product of experience in years and positions held.\n\nTable 6. FMECA Respondents and weights.\n\n| Positions | Respondents | Experience | Ag Weight | Applied weight (%) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| WKO/WKD | 2 | 0–5years | 50 + 0 | 0.5 |\n| WKDWEO/MEO | 2 | 5–11 years | 60 + 0 | 0.6 |\n| WEO/MEO | 4 | 11–15 years | 65 + 5 | 0.7 |\n| FSWEO/FSMEO | 5 | 15–20 years | 70 + 10 | 0.8 |\n| FSMO/FSG CMDR | 3 | 20–24 years | 75 + 15 | 0.9 |\n| FSMO/FSG CMDR | 2 | 24–28 years | 80 + 20 | 1 |\n| FSG CMDR | 2 | 28–35 years | 100 + 0 | 1 |\n\nThe FMECA survey consisted of about 20 questions on various types of faults and failure conditions covering DG system including the [alternator](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/alternator \"Learn more about alternator from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). All respondents are engineers with varying experience and specialisation. The 2 specializations are Marine and Weapon Electrical Engineers with experience levels between 5 and 35 years of service considering position occupied. The 2 variables, namely experience and specialisation were used as weights in percentages and applied to individual inputs of the respondents. Accordingly, all individual inputs were evaluated to reflect years of experience and specialisation of the respondents based on equation [(14)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#fd14). Adopting the above weights, individual responses were evaluated according to experience and specialisation to obtain the population mean equation [(15)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#fd15).equation 14$<math><mrow is=\"true\"><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">W</mi><mn is=\"true\">1</mn></msub><mo linebreak=\"badbreak\" is=\"true\">=</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><munderover is=\"true\"><mo is=\"true\">∑</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">i</mi><mo linebreak=\"badbreak\" is=\"true\">&gt;</mo><mn is=\"true\">0</mn></mrow><mi is=\"true\">n</mi></munderover><mrow is=\"true\"><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">C</mi><mn is=\"true\">1</mn></msub><mrow is=\"true\"><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">(</mo><mfrac is=\"true\"><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">e</mi><mo linebreak=\"badbreak\" is=\"true\">+</mo><mi is=\"true\">s</mi></mrow><mn is=\"true\">100</mn></mfrac><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">)</mo></mrow><mo linebreak=\"badbreak\" is=\"true\">+</mo></mrow></mrow><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">C</mi><mn is=\"true\">2</mn></msub><mrow is=\"true\"><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">(</mo><mfrac is=\"true\"><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">e</mi><mo linebreak=\"badbreak\" is=\"true\">+</mo><mi is=\"true\">s</mi></mrow><mn is=\"true\">100</mn></mfrac><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">)</mo></mrow><mo is=\"true\">…</mo><mo is=\"true\">.</mo><mo is=\"true\">.</mo><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">C</mi><mi is=\"true\">i</mi></msub><mrow is=\"true\"><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">(</mo><mfrac is=\"true\"><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">e</mi><mo linebreak=\"badbreak\" is=\"true\">+</mo><mi is=\"true\">s</mi></mrow><mn is=\"true\">100</mn></mfrac><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></math>$Where _W_<sub><em>1</em></sub> is the weighted component score for rank 1, n is the number of respondents in that rank, C is evaluated criterion.equation 15$<math><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">μ</mi><mo linebreak=\"badbreak\" is=\"true\">=</mo><mfrac is=\"true\"><mrow is=\"true\"><mo is=\"true\">∑</mo><mi is=\"true\">x</mi></mrow><mi is=\"true\">N</mi></mfrac></mrow></math>$Where μ is the population mean, x = data values, N = number of samples.\n\nUsing the population mean for each group the weighted RPN for each subsystem and component was evaluated and normalised to ≤100 as presented in [Table 7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#tbl7).\n\nTable 7. FMECA RPN values of Most critical failures.\n\n![](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0029801823001506-fx3.jpg)\n\n### 4.2. Objective analysis\n\nThe objective phase of the case study provides a system reliability analysis using quantitative failure rates values of the 4 marine DGs, therefore providing a numerically objective output. The DFTA results includes component reliability, importance measures (criticality) and cut sets, which provide a significant understanding on the DGs reliability. However, it was difficult to identify specific repair, maintenance or component failure that present the highest challenge to the operators. Therefore, considering that the MCS is a combination of minimum number of events which must occur for the top event to occur (component failure); it therefor provides a good source of variables for building the BBN while taking additional inputs from the FMECA as RPN. Accordingly, this study is utilising the MCS of the DFTA to build the BN analysis by identifying top 10 most critical components as presented in [Table 7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#tbl7) above.\n\nThe DFTA analysis provides both qualitative and quantitative calculations. The qualitative analysis is performed using the structure of the DFTA dependent on logic properties of the gates, while the quantitative analysis uses MRO data such as failure rate, [MTBF](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/mtbf \"Learn more about MTBF from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), and frequency. The quantitative analysis outputs are objective results that includes system unreliability, unavailability and reliability importance measures which provide critical components failures. However, the MCS evaluation is based on the output evaluated using the logic combination of the top event occurrence usually from left to right. Therefore, to obtain the MCS the DFTA structure representing each DG was built based on the functional relationship and system boundary of the sub-systems of the respective marine DGs. MCS are product of the fault tree which forms the failure path of an evaluated fault tree, i.e the smallest set of basic events, which if they all occur will result in the top event occurring ([NASA, 2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib49)). However, it is important to note that a single basic event can equally form a cut set depending on the arrangement of the fault tree, [Fig. 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#fig3) provides some instance of MCS. Sub-system 1 having an AND gate fails only when all the events have occurred however the intermediate OR gate fail when any of its BEs occur, while in the case of sub-system 2, the occurrence of BE7 or BE8 is an MCS. Similarly, occurrence of any of the BEs in sub-system 3 forms a cut set for the sub-system. This highlights potential area where improvements can be achieved through alternative maintenance approach, redesign or simply altering the system to improve its reliability.\n\n![Fig. 3](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0029801823001506-gr3.jpg)\n\n1.

Instances of MCS formation.\n\nThe next step after the MCSs were obtained was to build the BBN structure using the MCS probability of occurrence as inputs to the CPT. Therefore, using a bottom-up approach, discrete chance nodes were used to model faults which are then connected to parent chance nodes representing component having probability values as inputs to the CPT, the top 10 MCS used for building the BBN are contained in [Table 8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#tbl8). Overall, 8 subsystems and dependent components were modelled and analysed in the BN structure. The component chance nodes are linked to all possible faults including faults in other subsystems that could elicit multiple component failures that could result to greater maintenance or availability problems. The flexibility in BN which allows modelling CCF is very helpful in presenting complex failure interactions between components that serve many systems or subsystems.\n\nTable 8. Top 10 cut sets for DG1-4.\n\n| DG1 | DG 2 | DG3 | DG4 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Crankshaft journal failure | Fuel Injection pump Mechanical failure | Crankshaft journal failure | HP fuel pipe leakages |\n| Fuel Filter (1&2) | FW Heat Exchanger Fouling | FW Heat Exchanger Fouling | FW Heat exchanger tube fouling |\n| Sea Chest blockage | Tappet clearance (In&Ex) | RW impeller Damage | Rocker arm and Tappets clearance |\n| Tappet clearance (In&Ex) | Burnt top cylinder gasket | Turbo charger lub failure | Governor drive |\n| Cylinder Head sealing | Clogged Air filter | Cylinder head gasket damage | Intercooler fins fouling |\n| Fuel Lift pump defects | Injector Nozzle faults | Injector nozzles faults | Turbo charger |\n| Turbo Charger leakages | Clogged Air filter | blocked fuel filter | Cylinder Head gasket damage |\n| Cylinder jacket cracks | Oil filter | Piston crown damage | Loose cylinder head bolts |\n| Low fuel pressure | No Fuel Supply | Tappet clearance | Clogged air filter |\n| RW water impeller | Defective fuel pump | Loose cylinder head bolts | Injector camshaft failure |\n\nThe process also enables more efficiently evaluation of the MCS and there impacts were more highlighted using BN analysis, hence one of the many reasons of using BN for this analysis. Moreover, the cumulative probability of the child nodes occurrence determines the operational health condition of the parent component node at the sub-system level; [Fig. 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#fig4) is a sample of the BBN structure for DG2, showing 3 out of the 8 subsystem and an abridge part of the CPT.\n\n![Fig. 4](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0029801823001506-gr4.jpg)\n\n1.

As can be seen in the structure the yellow nodes represent the failure cause, the light green nodes represent component failure while the sub-system are rectangle grey nodes with bar chart and the topmost blue node represents the DG. The arrows from the nodes are linked across sub-system to model common cause faults (CCF), which is typical of many [mechanical systems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/mechanical-systems \"Learn more about mechanical systems from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") especially due to temperature and load related failures. The BBN model clearly present those CCFs that can impact multiple subsystems hence provides a good reference point for the DSS.\n\n![Fig. 5](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0029801823001506-gr5.jpg)\n\n1.

BBN structure for DG 3.\n\nThe DSS was built on the existing BN structure and takes inputs from all the 8 subsystems and RPN values. Therefore, within the DSS process the non-availability of subsystem obtained in the BN is translated to reflect the ranking table in line with RPN structure as earlier presented in [Table 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#tbl5). Additional nodes namely decision and value nodes were used in conjunction with the chance nodes. The decision nodes are used to represent variables controlled by the [decision maker](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/decision-maker \"Learn more about decision maker from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") while the value nodes provide a measure of the [desirability](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/desirability \"Learn more about desirability from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of the decision outcomes based on DSS process as shown in [Fig. 6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#fig6).\n\n![Fig. 6](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0029801823001506-gr6.jpg)\n\n1.

Accordingly, the value nodes had RPN values that serve as measurement of how the operators perceive the impact of failure on the DGs while ship operational availability has RPN as its inputs. In this regard the 8 chance nodes connect to value node provides the DG availability inputs in percentages while the 2 decision nodes feed in decision choices as regards the DGs availability and sub-system criticality as shown in [Fig. 7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#fig7).\n\n![Fig. 7](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0029801823001506-gr7.jpg)\n\n1.

Results and discussion\n\nThis section presents the results of the analysis based on the implementation of the presented methodology and DGs in the case study. This section will start with the subjective analysis result on the FMECA output, thereafter the objective aspect will be presented to cover DFTA MCS use for BBN as well as the BN and DSS results.\n\n### 5.1. FMECA RPN\n\nThe FMECA survey outputs provides a very important input to the overall analysis as regards what may have not been carefully accounted for in the maintenance and repair data collected from the DGs. Moreover, the MRO used was for and individual ship while the FMECA data was the response from over 20 experts with varying professional experience. Though the FMECA has in no way influenced the DFTA results it was mainly used to complement it for the second aspect of the BBN analysis which is the maintenance DSS. The fact that DFTA cannot account for issues to do with unplanned downtime, quality of replacement parts, design related unreliability and generic [human factor](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/ergonomics \"Learn more about human factor from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") concern. The FMECA helps in addressing these issues as well as other environmentally induced failures which were not factored during installation but were not necessarily design related. Therefore, the FMECA survey was designed to capture some of these problems, to also highlight how the operators evaluated the most critical failures to ship availability and repairs.\n\nIt is important to understand the peculiarities and the condition of [Naval ship](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/warship \"Learn more about Naval ship from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") operations, as regard [operational requirements](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/operational-requirement \"Learn more about operational requirements from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and system demand onboard. A [standard operating procedure](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/standard-operating-procedure \"Learn more about standard operating procedure from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") for naval ships is parallel operation of DGs during certain exercises, navigational circumstances and load demands. In this regard, despite the redundancy in [power generation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/power-generation \"Learn more about power generation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") system it is usual to have load shading due to high demands from other utilities. Therefore, the power generation system is one system that naval ships cannot afford to compromised.\n\nIt is therefore common to have ships undertake repairs while under way to ensure that at least 2 DGs are available, hence any repair that cannot be undertaken by ship's staff while underway is viewed as critical and can affect overall ship availability or deployments. The results of the FMECA highlights these critical failures which may not be seen as important by OEMs, but the operator's environment and operational circumstance made it so. Consequently, [Table 9](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#tbl9) above, is the FMECA RPN values obtained from response of operators, which details how the operators perceive the importance of DGs against the navy's operational demands, maintenance practice and capabilities including environmental conditions.\n\nTable 9. FMECA RPN values of Most critical failures.\n\n![](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0029801823001506-fx4.jpg)\n\nA look at the table indicates majority of faults with low likelihood have high criticality and severity values. Therefore, taking from the definition of these 2 factors the operators are more concern with failures that affects ship availability. This is not to say safety is not of concern, in fact the threat to safety as regards loss in power generation output could be in 2 folds. First is safety and security both external and internal to the ship. The second is operational external safety to do with threats to national assets and safety of navigation which is equally a safety concern to personnel onboard. Hence, faults that can be fixed while underway or which do not expose the ship to danger i.e. loss of 2 out of the 4 DGs is within acceptable limits. Therefore, consideration for the maintenance strategy selection needs to be dynamic to reflect the prevailing operational and health condition of the DGs. Hence the need to consider the interaction between objective and subjective data sources to provide balance in the DSS analysis.\n\n### 5.2. DFTA\n\nMCS obtained through DFTA for individual sub systems were used as inputs to build the BN probability analysis. MCS being a combination of events or failures that leads to the system or subsystem failure can be efficiently utilised to improve system availability. Nonetheless, some failures can be triggered by a fault in another system, especially in marine diesel generators where many faults are interrelated due to system dependencies. For instance, one of the most important failures on the DGs was [crank case](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/crank-case \"Learn more about crank case from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") failure but influenced by multiple factors from other subsystem such as the lubricating system and the cooling freshwater system as well as the air distribution system. This makes it difficult to isolate failure to faults, so the approach in this research is to identify the MCS, and link the components and their probability of occurrence, as shown in [Table 10](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#tbl10). This way the operators will be able prioritise maintenance and identify spare parts shortages as necessary.\n\nTable 10. Top 10 cut set and probability of occurrence.\n\n| DG1 | Probability | DG 2 | Probability | DG3 | Probability | DG4 | Probability |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Crankshaft journal failure | 0.49 | Fuel Injection pump Mechanical failure | 0.82 | Crankshaft journal failure | 0.78 | HP fuel pipe leakages | 0.85 |\n| Fuel Filter (1&2) | 0.87 | FW Heat Exchanger Fouling | 0.67 | FW Heat Exchanger Fouling | 0.94 | FW Heat exchanger tube fouling | 0.7 |\n| Sea Chest blockage | 0.71 | Tappet clearance (In&Ex) | 0.82 | RW impeller Damage | 0.84 | Rocker arm and Tappets clearance | 0.86 |\n| Tappet clearance (In&Ex) | 0.52 | Burnt top cylinder gasket | 0.86 | Turbo charger lub failure | 0.75 | Governor drive | 0.77 |\n| Cylinder Head sealing | 0.75 | Clogged Air filter | 0.75 | Cylinder head gasket damage | 0.72 | intercooler fins fouling | 0.53 |\n| Fuel Lift pump defects | 0.82 | Injector Nozzle faults | 0.74 | Injector nozzles cylinder | 0.72 | Turbo charger | 0.52 |\n| Turbo Charger leakages | 0.54 | Clogged Air filter | 0.76 | blacked fuel filter | 0.76 | Cylinder Head gasket damage | 0.73 |\n| Cylinder jacket cracks | 0.5 | Oil filter | 0.46 | Piston crown damage | 0.87 | Loose cylinder head bolts | 0.64 |\n| Low fuel pressure | 0.63 | No Fuel Supply | 0.78 | Tappet clearance | 0.8 | Clogged air filter |  |\n| RW water impeller | 0.84 | Defective fuel pump | 0.82 | Loose cylinder head bolts | 0.68 | Injector camshaft failure | 0.54 |\n\nMoreover, another important factor with MCS is that events are considered based on their contribution to failure not only occurrence. In some cases, failure occurrence may not necessarily be the reason why a component becomes critical to maintenance. In most cases factors such as [down time](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/downtime \"Learn more about down time from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), cost of repairs and repair capability could be major concerns for operators. For Instance, overheating related failures are dominated by sea water [heat exchanger](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/heat-exchanger \"Learn more about heat exchanger from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") scale build-up and are mainly of concern because of the envisaged operational interruption. However, [lubrication system](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/lubrication-system \"Learn more about lubrication system from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") failures or losing alternator exciter which seldom happens but their occurrence could lead to serious consequence. These types of faults are well captured by MCS formation in DFT analysis, however the DFTA structure does not support the modelling of MCS that can develop to CCF covering more than one subsystem. Hence BBN was adopted to overcome the challenge of CCF, while accommodating course effect analysis considering multiple operational factors.\n\n### 5.3. BBN and maintenance DSS\n\nPower generations system reliability is of great concern for all ship operators irrespective of sector, as it provides the highest utility and ensures collective safety of operators, passengers, equipment and cargo. In this regard the BBN model investigated multiple failure types and their impact on components and DG availability. Modelled components were from DFTA MCS and their failure probability from the collected MRO data. This input was used to obtain the availability for individual DGs as well as the main subsystems modelled, as shown in [Table 11](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#tbl11). The results shows that all 4 DGs had varying degrees of availability with DG2 being slightly more available as compared to the rest. The subsystem availability particularly that of the lubricating system of DG2 at 75% is an important pointer. Moreover, the lubricating subsystem is one of the most reliable subsystems in most DGs, this can be attributed to the centrality of its function particularly to the moving parts and heat transfer. On the other hand, a very critical situation is presented in the cooling system with availability values below 40% which is far below the expected availability of the operator. The low availability values could be linked to the sea chest blockages which can be very frequent and rapid due to scale build-up on the [cooling fins](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/cooling-fin \"Learn more about cooling fins from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). Nonetheless, the cooling system for the ships in question has at least 4 redundant sources of water supply in addition to the inline source, while this design helps reduce the risk of overheating due to delays in switching water sources. It is important that an [early warning system](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/early-warning-system \"Learn more about early warning system from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") is provided to ensure that watch keepers are adequately alerted at the onset of any pressure reduction in water supply or temperature increase for at least 10 min with no corresponding increase in demands or beyond normal threshold.\n\nTable 11. BBN DG and Component availability.\n\n| DG | DG1 | DG2 | DG3 | DG4 | Empty Cell |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Availability | 50% | 53% | 48% | 47% |  |\n| Subsystem Availability |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Cylinder Block | 47% | 43% | 44% | 44% |  |\n| PTO | 60% | 56% | 50% | 60% |  |\n| Cooling | 37% | 39% | 39% | 37% |  |\n| Fuel System | 43% | 45% | 44% | 44% |  |\n| Air Distribution | 50% | 52% | 52% | 42% |  |\n| Lubrication | 62% | 75% | 56% | 55% |  |\n| Inlet and Exhaust | 60% | 63% | 62% | 58% |  |\n| Alternator | 59% | 52% | 59% | 57% |  |\n\nFurthermore, the DG availability can be used independently to aid maintenance planning, in that the subsystem availability indicates where maintenance effort should be directed. However, to improve maintenance decision making additional issues that influence delivery and quality of maintenance needs to be considered. In this regard the FMECA provides a solution, and it was used for building the DSS with other inputs from the availability and maintenance strategy choices. Overall, the 4 maintenance strategy options namely Corrective Action, ConMon, PMS and Delay Action. The first 2 options are meant for high critical failures or component with severe failure consequences while the last 2 are to address failures with time dependent pattern or equipment with high redundancy and low criticality. The maintenance criticality also has 4 levels which are, Very High, High, Medium and Low and these conforms' with the maintenance strategy in order of hierarchy. The same also applies to the RPN values against the maintenance strategy options.\n\nThe approach compares the criticality in decreasing priority from very high to low based on RPN numerical values where 100 represent the highest possible outcome and 0 lowest possible outcome. The RPN values provide an iterative procedure using the linear scale ranges to place components to certain maintenance strategy group. Therefore, this helps ease some of the restriction of the component criticality Likert scale, hence providing a flexible procedure to prioritise system maintenance. Accordingly, the inputs for the overall BBN DSS comprise of the subsystem RPN, critical components and their cut set as well as the relevant CCF as shown in [Table 12](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#tbl12). Consequently, using these values, the DSS was built based on the structure shown in [Fig. 8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#fig8) representing DG 2, showing the 3 additional nodes, 2 decision nodes on orange and 1 utility node in yellow. The decision node ‘Maintenance Decision’ is defined by independent variables of maintenance strategy choices and is a parent to Utility node which is a dependent variable and child to another decision node ‘RPN’. The decision node ‘RPN’ takes information representing the maintenance decision arrangements and matched with RPN criticality hierarchy based on RPN scale.\n\nTable 12. Summary of BN DSS inputs.\n\n| Sub-System | RPN | Components | MSC | CCF | Mode | Causes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Cylinder Block | 65% | 7 | 6 | 1 | Overheating | No cooling water, lubrication oil failure, vibration, gasket damage, seizure |\n| PTO | 58% | 3 | 2 | 2 | Seizure, Overheating | Missed timing, Overheating, |\n| Cooling | 64% | 6 | 2 | 3 | Reduced Cooling, No cooling | Sea chest blockages, scaling, thermostat fault, Pump failure |\n| Fuel System | 34% | 5 | 4 | 3 | Low Pressure, No supply, contamination | Air log, dirty tanks, filter blockage, fuel quality |\n| Air Distribution | 33% | 2 | 2 | 0 | Low supply, Hot air | Air filter blockage, air cooler fouling |\n| Lubrication | 3% | 3 | 2 | 0 | Low pressure, | Filter blockage, |\n| No supply, | Pump failure |\n| contamination | Seal failure |\n| Inlet and Exhaust | 0% | 4 | 4 | 3 | Missed timing, valve clearance, poor scavenge | Valve setting/tappet clearance, weak spring, valve seat, bent valve stem |\n| Alternator | 14% | 4 | 10 | 5 | Overheating, rubbing, load shedding, no output, degraded performance (low voltage/frequency) | Bearing failure.

BBN component availability and RPN.\n\nFollowing from the above, the DSS allocates percentage values between 0 and 100 to each of the 4-maintenance strategy choice for the DG based on the input data. The allocated percentage for each of the strategy determines how the maintenance action, planning and monitoring should be prioritised. This allows for flexibility regarding distribution of resources such as personnel, spare parts, logistic support and operational deployment. Furthermore, high criticality ranking for ConMon indicates the need for additional monitoring approach which can be addition of sensors, increased inspection frequency or watchkeeping attention.\n\nThe overall outcome for the maintenance strategy selection DSS of the DGs is presented in [Fig. 9](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#fig9). The analysis indicates how each of the DGs fit to a certain maintenance strategy regime as a reflection of the main variables i.e utility and RPN. In all, Corrective Action and ConMon appear to be the most preferred choice for all the DGs except for DG1 with relatively low figures in ConMon but high in PMS.\n\n![Fig. 9](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0029801823001506-gr9.jpg)\n\n1.

Maintenance DSS choice for all DGs.\n\nOnly DG1 and 2 seem to have some values for Delay Action and present high figures both Corrective Action and ConMon. This suggests that the 2 generators are highly maintenance intensive, moreover DG1 has about 54% to corrective action and DG2 is about 58% in ConMon. On the other hand, DG3 and DG4 fall in relatively similar level of priority levels except in PMS where DG4 numbers appear much higher than that of DG3. A likely reason for this could be that DG1 and 2 are located in the same engine room likewise DG 3 and 4. As such due to shared resources such as sea chest, ventilation, fuel line and local stress such vibration, the generators tend to present similar pattern of failure. Though some of these findings were not apparent to the operators prior to this research, however were consistent with similar research findings within the [shipping industry](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/shipping-industry \"Learn more about shipping industry from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") ([Goossens and Basten, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib31); [Lazakis and Ölçer, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib41); [Lazakis et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib43)) and others with focus on Naval ship platforms ([Berghout et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib8); [Tomlinson, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib63)).Moreover, the FMECA findings also provide additional evidence as to the [acceptability](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/acceptability \"Learn more about acceptability from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of the research findings and relevance of the methodology.\n\n## 6\\. Conclusions\n\nThe maintenance department in large organisations help to ensure platform availability through the implementation of a maintenance strategy which fits best to organisational roles. In this regard the effort of the maintenance department is to utilise the strategy within its disposal to ensure that failures are not only minimised but are managed in an economical and timely manner. Maintenance efforts onboard also ensures that ship operators meet the IMO and ISM code provision on emission reduction and safety respectively. In this regard this research paper presented a novel methodology through the combination of reliability analysis and decision support system to help provide the most efficient maintenance strategy option for a given system and components by combining DFTA, FMECA and BBN. The methodology was implemented in the presented case study of an OPV power generation system consisting of 4 marine diesel generators. Modelled components originated from MCS obtained through DFTA and their failure probability from the collected MRO data. This input was used to obtain the availability for individual DGs as well as the main subsystems modelled. The RPN from the FMECA was generic to all generators, but the MCS from the DFTA was not, hence the DFTA cut set output was the source for the component inputs that form the child nodes in the BBN for each of the 4 DGs, while failure rates were used as inputs for the CPT. The inputs provided analytical data for ships availability analysis in BN model. The maintenance DSS was built on the existing BN with additional influence diagrams nodes taking inputs from RPN and maintenance strategy choice.\n\nOverall, the results show that all 4 DGs had varying degrees of availability with DG2 being slightly more available as compared to the rest. The subsystem availability particularly that of the lubricating system of DG2 at 75% is an important pointer. On the other hand, a very critical situation is presented in the cooling system with availability values below 40% which is far below the expected availability of the operator pegged at 80%. The results overall indicates’ that Corrective Action and ConMon appear to be the most preferred choice for all the DGs except for the DG1 with relatively low figures in ConMon but high in PMS. Only DG1 and 2 seem to have some values for Delay Action and presented high figures both Corrective Action and ConMon. This suggests that the two generators are highly maintenance intensive, moreover DG1 has about 54% to corrective action and DG2 is about 58% in ConMon. On the other hand, DG3 and DG4 fall in relatively similar level of priority levels this except in PMS where DG4 numbers appear much higher than that of DG3. One of the major reasons for this could be that DG1 and 2 are located in the same engine room likewise DG 3 and 4, hence are affected by the same factors. Consequently, based on the outcome of the case study especially on subsystems with low availability values such as the cooling system, which can be linked to the sea chest blockages and scale built-up on the [cooling fins](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/cooling-fin \"Learn more about cooling fins from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). This is despite a relatively high redundancy in the cooling water sources, but delays in switch water sources could still lead to overheating. Therefore based on the results the following are recommended.\n\n-   •\n    \n    [Early warning system](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/early-warning-system \"Learn more about Early warning system from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") be provided to ensure that watch keepers are adequately alerted at the onset of any pressure reduction in water supply or temperature increase for at least 10 min with no corresponding increase in demands or beyond normal threshold.\n    \n-   •\n    \n    Provision of additional online [pressure sensors](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/pressure-probe \"Learn more about pressure sensors from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") on the sea [water line](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/water-piping-systems \"Learn more about water line from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\").\n    \n-   •\n    \n    Consider use of cooling water additives and increased flushing frequency of the cooling water tubes.\n    \n\nMoreover, further research efforts to extend the presented work could include the use and application of [artificial neural networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/artificial-neural-network \"Learn more about artificial neural networks from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") for fault detection and the development of a methodology for estimating the remaining useful life of ship system components, along with a spare parts estimation process. Furthermore, in light of shipping decarbonization, the application of the aforementioned methodology and tools can be extended to ship system reliability analysis on the impact of the use of biofuels and [alternative fuels](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/alternative-fuel \"Learn more about alternative fuels from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") on the reliability assessment of engine system components.\n\n## CRediT authorship contribution statement\n\n**Abdullahi Abdulkarim Daya:** Conceptualization, Methodology, Data Collection, Software, Validation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – original draft, Visualization. **Iraklis Lazakis:** Conceptualization, Validation, Resources, Writing - review, Supervision.\n\n## Declaration of competing interest\n\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe research is funded by the Federal Government of Nigeria through the Petroleum Technology Development Fund, Scholarship Number:[17PHD178](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#gs1)\n\n## Data availability\n\nData will be made available on request.\n\n## References\n\n1.

Therefore, a promising application combining PSS and equipment portrait is to establish a more refined portrait model to improve the accuracy and applicability of operation and maintenance (OM) schemes for industrial products. However, studies in the above field are facing many challenges. For example, the research on equipment portrait in the industrial field is still in its infancy. PSS and equipment portrait are studied separately, and the overall solution that integrates PSS and equipment portrait for complex products OM service is almost vacant. A personalised OM approach for complex products (POMA-CP) is proposed to address these challenges. First, a framework of POMA-CP is developed to show how the processes of refined OM can be implemented. Then, a solution of POMA-CP based on the framework is designed. A multi-level case library, dynamic equipment portrait model, and case-pushing mechanism are established and developed. Active pushing of the best similar cases and automatic generation of service schemes are realised. Finally, an application scenario for a high-speed electric multiple units (EMU) bogie is presented to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Higher accuracy and applicability for service schemes are achieved, resulting in the efficient reusing of OM knowledge, proactive implementation of refined maintenance, and reducing maintenance cost and resource consumption.\n\n-   [Previous](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S073658452200165X)\n-   [Next](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001715)\n\n##

Introduction\n\nProduct complexity has been described in the literature as having many dimensions (including the number of components, the number of modules, the diversity of relations between components, and the commonality of products in an assortment) [\\[1\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0001), [\\[2\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0002), [\\[3\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0003), while complex products are usually defined as a durable product with a lifespan of over 10–30 years [\\[4\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0004). In addition, complex products also have the characteristics of complex structure, long research and development (R&D) cycle, strict quality control and high maintenance service requirements \\[[5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0005),[6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0006)\\]. Therefore, complex products’ [operation and maintenance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/operation-and-maintenance \"Learn more about operation and maintenance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") (OM) service can provide huge potential for establishing a balance amongst users, [original equipment manufacturers](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/original-equipment-manufacturer \"Learn more about original equipment manufacturers from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") (OEMs), and natural environment \\[[7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0007),[8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0008)\\]. Complex products’ personalised OM service demands are emerging with the ever-increasing usage of customised products. As a result, many OEMs are making efforts to employ the product-service system (PSS) to provide high value-added service for their users to improve customer satisfaction and promote the implementation of cleaner production (CP) and circular economy (CE) strategies \\[[\\[9\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0009), [\\[10\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0010), [\\[11\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib69)\\].\n\nWith the advancement of smart technologies in the [Industry 4.0](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/industry-4-0 \"Learn more about Industry 4.0 from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") paradigm, the research on integrating PSS with OM services has attracted many scholars’ attention. As pointed out by Zheng et al. \\[[12](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0011),[13](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0012)\\], the combination of PSS and smart technologies can enable innovative applications of OM service for complex products. Exner et al. \\[[14](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0013)\\] analysed how OM services can be connected to the PSS to enhance machine availability while [reducing energy consumption](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/reducing-energy-consumption \"Learn more about reducing energy consumption from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and the cost of maintenance procedures. D. Mourtzis et al. \\[[15](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0014)\\] studied an unscheduled OM service of manufacturing equipment following the PSS. A maintenance planning system was proposed to facilitate [knowledge sharing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/knowledge-sharing \"Learn more about knowledge sharing from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") amongst OEMs, users and service providers within the PSS \\[[16](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0015)\\]. Recent research achievements, such as PSS-based maintenance grouping strategy \\[[17](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0016)\\], process-based OM service [knowledge management](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/knowledge-management \"Learn more about knowledge management from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") mechanism \\[[18](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0017)\\], sustainable service-orientated equipment maintenance \\[[19](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0018)\\], active [preventive maintenance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/preventive-maintenance \"Learn more about preventive maintenance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") with lifecycle big data \\[[6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0006),[8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0008),[20](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0019)\\], and lease-orientated opportunistic maintenance \\[[21](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0020)\\], etc., have provided significant references for industrial practitioners to develop and apply the PSS-based product OM pattern.\n\nHowever, the PSS-based OM services face new issues while the increase in product complexity and industrial automation. For instance, how to effectively integrate the scattered and multi-stage stakeholders and [lifecycle data](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/lifecycle-data \"Learn more about lifecycle data from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), rationally apply the historical OM service knowledge, and facilitate the OEMs to carry out personalised and refined OM services. Fortunately, equipment portrait, as an emerging technology derived from user portrait, can accurately describe personalised user needs \\[[22](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0021)\\] and construct fine-grained portrait models to analyse complex products’ operational status and fault symptoms \\[[23](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0022)\\]. Besides, equipment portrait has achieved initial success in software product development and maintenance \\[[24](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0023)\\], machine tools intelligent maintenance \\[[25](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0024)\\], and water supply infrastructures OM service \\[[26](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0025)\\]. Therefore, the equipment portrait shows great potential for addressing the above issues and realising personalised and refined product OM services.\n\nDespite the progress achieved by the researchers in the abovementioned work, new questions are arising from applying equipment portrait to personalised OM service of complex products in the [big data environment](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/big-data-environment \"Learn more about big data environment from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and Industry 4.0 paradigm:\n\nFirst, the core of equipment portrait is extracting the set of feature labels. However, the lifecycle data of complex products is usually characterized by high volume, high velocity and high variety \\[[27](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0026)\\]. As a result, it is difficult for industrial practitioners to effectively define different feature labels of products according to specific application scenarios when they are not clear on how to use the lifecycle data best \\[[28](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0027)\\]. That is, the prescriptive and structured processes for the establishment of equipment portrait models for complex products to make OM service decisions were seldom investigated. As pointed out by Liu et al. \\[[29](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0028)\\], a promising application of equipment portrait in the industrial field is the use of its model to conduct a targeted analysis of the performance of products and systems. Therefore, the authors highlight an important research question (RQ1): how should an equipment portrait-based framework for OM service delivery and execution process of industrial complex products be structured to exploit the values of portrait technology in product OM service activities?\n\nSecond, current research on product OM mostly combines either equipment portrait and maintenance service \\[[30](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0029)\\] or aligns PSS mode with maintenance policy planning \\[[17](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0016),[31](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0030)\\]. As pointed out by Grover et al. \\[[32](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0031)\\], the interaction of accessible product data and efficient [data analytics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/data-analytics \"Learn more about data analytics from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and appropriate business model can obtain more insights to improve maintenance services. However, virtually no literature provides knowledge of exploiting equipment portrait and PSS to bring out value from lifecycle data, and to carry out more precisely and prescriptive maintenance measures \\[[33](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0032),[34](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0033)\\]. This resulted in the industrial practitioners being unable to comprehensively and accurately assess the operational conditions of complex products, which makes it difficult to fulfil the current requirements of personalised and refined product OM services. This limitation stimulated another research question (RQ2): what methods can be applied to effectively integrate portrait technologies and PSS mode to extract knowledge from PSS delivery process data and to define feature labels, so as to support an equipment portrait-based decision for the OM service delivery and execution process?\n\nThis paper proposed a personalised OM approach for complex products (POMA-CP) based on equipment portrait within the PSS mode to answer both of the above questions. The proposed method can contribute to constructing a more accurate equipment portrait model based on the comprehensive, meticulous and personalised requirement information of complex products OM services. It is important to emphasise that, with the wide application of smart technologies in Industry 4.0, the large amount of data related to the product's operational status and the whole lifecycle captured in the PSS delivery processes are valuable assets for extracting the above information. Therefore, the combined PSS and equipment portrait application is not simply a study of innovative product management but provides a new paradigm for realising the preventive and refined as well as personalised OM service for complex products. The proposed approach has strong flexibility and adaptability toward complex products’ OM services in big data and Industry 4.0 environments. As a result, two such technologies incorporate numerous potentials for industrial practitioners to implement personalised and refined OM services.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organised as follows. [Section 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0002) reviews the relevant literature. [Section 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0006) and [Section 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0007) outline the overall framework and solution of POMA-CP based on equipment portrait, respectively. In [Section 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0020), an application scenario is presented to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. The conclusions, limitations, and future works are summarised in [Section 6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0025).\n\n## 2\\. Literature review\n\nThis section briefly reviews related studies in two aspects: (1) user portrait and equipment portrait, and (2) PSS-based product [OM](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/operation-and-maintenance \"Learn more about OM from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") service. The application of PSS mode creates the capability for [OEMs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/original-equipment-manufacturer \"Learn more about OEMs from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") to better control and manage their products, which in turn makes it possible to access and acquire the whole [lifecycle data](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/lifecycle-data \"Learn more about lifecycle data from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of PSS delivery processes \\[[6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0006),[35](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0034)\\]. These data can be analysed to provide sufficient feature labels set for constructing of more accurate and refined equipment portrait. Meanwhile, a promising application of equipment portrait is the use of its feature labels for specific scenarios to improve the efficiency and accuracy of OM services decision-making. Therefore, the PSS mode and portrait technology (user portrait or equipment portrait) are two major pillars to exploit the potential of lifecycle data and to carry out the personalised and refined product OM services. Knowledge gaps identified from the review are summarised at the end of [Section 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0002).\n\n### 2.1. User portrait and equipment portrait\n\nThe most cited definition of user portrait was introduced by Cooper \\[[36](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0035)\\], who believed that user portrait was a virtual representation of real users. Meanwhile, the user portrait can be divided into different types according to different behaviours and motivations. As a result, the common features of different users can be extracted and described by some labels. The user portrait is based on the real user. However, it is not specific to a certain person or user. Meanwhile, user portrait emphasises the research on a certain type of object with common characteristics and standards. Therefore, for user portraits, a virtual object usually corresponds to one or a class of physical entities.\n\nWith the advent of big data, the connotation of user portraits has changed. Gauch and Speretta believed that user portrait is mainly composed of weighted keywords and semantic web \\[[37](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0036)\\]. Teixeira et al. \\[[38](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0037)\\] pointed out that a user portrait is an information set of personal data extracted from massive user data and a model to describe a user's needs and preferences. The main challenges of user portrait applications in adaptive [recommender systems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/recommender-systems \"Learn more about recommender systems from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and intelligent e-commerce systems were investigated by Schiaffino and Amandi \\[[39](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0038)\\]. To improve the accuracy and performance of user portraits, an ontology-based portrait learning method was proposed \\[[40](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0039)\\]. The author found that the user portrait information can be enriched by integrating data mining and semantics. In the [big data environment](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/big-data-environment \"Learn more about big data environment from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), user portrait and its privacy challenges were discussed by Hasan et al. \\[[41](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0040)\\]. The authors investigated a concrete example of constructing a portrait model with [big data techniques](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/big-data-technique \"Learn more about big data techniques from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and the approach to preserving user privacy. A user behaviour portrait was developed based on the mobile phone [trajectory data](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/trajectory-data \"Learn more about trajectory data from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") to judge [airport](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/airfield \"Learn more about airport from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") congestion and provide suggestions for airport users \\[[42](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0041)\\]. A user portrait-based [transfer learning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/transfer-learning \"Learn more about transfer learning from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") mechanism was designed to conduct knowledge transfer amongst the cross-domain recommender systems \\[[43](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0042)\\]. The results showed that the accuracy of the proposed method substantially outperforms other methods. To solve the sparse data problem of e-commerce recommender systems, a diffusion-based algorithm was proposed to generate the user portrait and perform personalised and high-quality recommendations \\[[44](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0043)\\]. The experiments showed that the proposed algorithm outperforms the traditional collaborative [filtering algorithm](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/filtering-algorithm \"Learn more about filtering algorithm from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). An intelligent method for constructing the academic WeChat user portrait was proposed to solve the asymmetry problem between users’ precise knowledge needs and academic WeChat extensive knowledge services \\[[45](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0044)\\]. According to equipment portrait, a task-orientated adaptive system was designed to provide an intelligent maintenance implementation process for complex products (e.g. automobiles, aeroplanes, and machine tools) \\[[25](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0024)\\]. Based on the features of different ambient temperatures and different life stages of electric vehicles' batteries, a charging unit portrait model was designed to optimise the battery OM services and to minimise degradation over the idling period while still satisfying the charging energy requirement \\[[30](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0029)\\].\n\n### 2.2. PSS-based product OM service\n\nAs reported by Si et al. \\[[46](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0045)\\] and Palmarini et al. \\[[47](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0046)\\], their reliability can be improved by analysing the operational data of complex products and executing relevant maintenance services. Due to the advantages of PSS for reducing product defects and improving maintenance task accuracy \\[[6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0006),[8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0008),[48](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0047)\\], the research on combining OM service and PSS is attracting more scholars’ interest.\n\nMarchi et al. \\[[49](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0048)\\] investigated the advantages of PSS-based maintenance activities for enhancing competitiveness and sustainability in the steel industry. The authors also analysed the influence of PSS design decisions on product reliability and OM activities. In order to increase productivity and perform accurate OM service, a PSS-based maintenance method supported by [augmented reality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/augmented-reality \"Learn more about augmented reality from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") was developed \\[[31](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0030)\\]. The authors found that the proposed method can be used to calculate the remaining operating time between failures and identify the available windows of the products to perform remote maintenance. After this, an assistance application of PSS-based [preventive maintenance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/preventive-maintenance \"Learn more about preventive maintenance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") for manufacturing equipment was introduced to improve the internal communication of Business to Business (B2B) and reduce time and cost during the maintenance service procedures \\[[15](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0014)\\]. An adaptive and PSS-based maintenance grouping strategy for complex multi-component systems was proposed to implement [predictive maintenance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/predictive-maintenance \"Learn more about predictive maintenance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") planning \\[[50](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0049)\\]. The author claimed that the proposed strategy could provide long-term dynamic planning for PSS providers. Within the [Internet of Things](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/internet-of-things \"Learn more about Internet of Things from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") (IoT) environment, how industrial practitioners can integrate real-time data and predictive analytics algorithms to manage maintenance policies dynamically and to realise PSS mode were explored by March and Scudder \\[[51](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0050)\\]. In the use-orientated PSS, a heuristic replacement policy and inventory control approach for condition-based product maintenance was formulated to improve the service provider's profitability \\[[52](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0051)\\]. A single case of engineering services for the maintenance and modification operations in offshore petroleum [logistics operations](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/logistics-operation \"Learn more about logistics operations from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") was studied to reveal the dynamics of building network capabilities in a consistent network structure, and to investigate the problem of manage economisation in service provision and use processes \\[[53](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0052)\\]. Based on the PSS mode, an opportunistic maintenance policy was developed to handle the challenges of multi-procedure capacity for serial-parallel leased systems and maximise the leasing profits \\[[21](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0020),[54](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0053)\\]. The authors suggest that the proposed policy can schedule maintenance intervals and can the maintenance decisions dynamically. A [joint](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/joints-structural-components \"Learn more about joint from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") optimisation model of maintenance and spare parts ordering policy was proposed for the use-orientated PSS to address the hardware failures and replacement spare parts problems \\[[55](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0054)\\]. The author demonstrated that the proposed policy could maximise system effectiveness by simultaneously considering the availability of systems, spares and repair engineers. A dual-perspective and data-based decision-making framework followed the PSS mode was developed and tested to manage the maintenance service delivery process of manufacturing companies \\[[56](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0055)\\]. Through a semi-structured interview, the authors found that the proposed framework can be used by manufacturing companies to explore the data generated in maintenance and use phase, and to improve their knowledge of machines and service processes. A framework of IoT enabled circular production and maintenance for automotive parts was outlined to facilitate organisation to pursue the integration of environmentally aware solutions in their production systems \\[[57](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0056)\\]. The proposed framework set out an agenda for digital maintenance practice within the CE and the utilisation of [Industry 4.0](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/industry-4-0 \"Learn more about Industry 4.0 from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") technologies.\n\n### 2.3. Knowledge gaps\n\nAlthough significant progress has been made in the two research dimensions mentioned above (as shown in [Table 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0001)), some gaps still need to be filled.\n\n-   n\n    \n    In terms of user portrait or equipment portrait, most existing studies mainly focused on the field of computer science, information science, e-commerce or recommender system, etc. The research in the industrial field for complex products was still in its infancy and seldom investigated.\n    \n-   n\n    \n    In respect of product OM service, most existing studies combined either equipment portrait and maintenance service or aligned PSS with product and system maintenance policy planning.

An overview framework of the POMA-CP based on equipment portrait\n\nThis section outlines a novel approach for personalised product OM service. The objective of the proposed approach is to better integrate the PSS delivery processes with equipment portrait to achieve personalised and refined services for complex products.\n\nThe overall framework of the proposed approach is designed and depicted in [Fig. 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#fig0001). Under this framework, the equipment portrait model can be dynamically changed and updated through the shared data and knowledge amongst different [lifecycle stages](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/lifecycle-stage \"Learn more about lifecycle stages from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of PSS delivery processes. Consequently, personalised, refined and accurate OM service can be achieved. The proposed framework includes four components, namely (1) lifecycle data acquisition and value-added processing, (2) OM knowledge mining and service case management, (3) equipment portrait modelling and OM scheme generation, and (4) application services of personalised OM for complex products.\n\n![Fig 1](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0736584522001673-gr1.jpg)\n\n1.

[Download : Download full-size image](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0736584522001673-gr1.jpg \"Download full-size image\")\n\nFig. 1. The overall framework of the POMA-CP based on equipment portrait.\n\nComponent 1 is responsible for acquiring product lifecycle data by emerging perceptive technology and achieving data value-added by bill of material (BOM) mapping. First, the [IoT](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/internet-of-things \"Learn more about IoT from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") devices and [smart sensors](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/smart-sensors \"Learn more about smart sensors from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") are configured for complex products and their key components at the beginning of life to improve the self-sensing ability of products in the middle of life and the end of life \\[[61](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib70)\\]. For example, the real-time position and operational status data of products can be obtained through the configured GPS and smart sensors in the operation stage. Furthermore, the configured [radio frequency identification](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/radio-frequency-identification \"Learn more about radio frequency identification from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") (RFID) tags and Auto-ID devices can be used to quickly identify the maintenance objects’ information in the maintenance stage. Second, various BOMs can be established based on the data of different lifecycle stages, including engineering BOM, manufacturing BOM, process planning BOM, etc. Similarly, a service BOM of the OM stage can be built to organise the massive OM data and provide value-added data for the OM service decision-making. In this paper, a composite BOM structure (consisting of neutral BOM, instance BOM, maintenance task BOM, and collectively called xBOM) is designed to establish the service BOM. Finally, an xBOM mapping technology can be developed to ensure OM service information's consistency and traceability. Thereby, reliable and holistic data assets can be provided for the personalised and refined product OM services.\n\nGenerally, experience-based maintenance service decisions will lead to lower service efficiency and customer satisfaction. Therefore, it is necessary to mine the OM service knowledge from the historical OM data to provide powerful knowledge support for the personalised OM services by effective [knowledge management](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/knowledge-management \"Learn more about knowledge management from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and reuse (Component 2 in [Fig. 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#fig0001)). First, the information or knowledge of product fault category (e.g., fault position, fault cause, fault occurrence time) should be analysed and mined to establish the fault tree model of complex products. Second, according to the mined fault [category knowledge](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/knowledge-category \"Learn more about category knowledge from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and the case-based reasoning technology, the multi-level OM service case libraries can be constructed to organise the maintenance domain knowledge effectively. For example, an OM service case library can be divided into several sub-case libraries based on the different fault categories. Then, the fault feature keywords can be mapped to a specific fault category. These case libraries can provide valuable knowledge support for the following cases’ active pushing processes while reducing case search time and improving case matching efficiency. Third, by extracting fault symptom keywords and establishing a fault-feature [vector space model](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/vector-space-models \"Learn more about vector space model from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), the characteristics of OM service cases can be expressed to manage the OM service knowledge. As a result, knowledge reuse for personalised OM services can be realised.\n\nTo carry out the personalised and refined OM services of complex products, equipment portraits of different operating conditions and environments should be depicted accurately (Component 3 in [Fig. 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#fig0001)). Generally, the equipment portrait is made up of a label set. Therefore, the label library of OM services should be first constructed. Based on the features and requirements of complex products’ OM services, a three dimensions label library (including behaviour, attribute and fault feature labels) is designed in this paper. Second, considering the dynamics of fault features, an equipment portrait model consisting of multiple feature items (each feature item represents a fault category) and weights can be established using the space vector. Each feature is divided into attribute, behaviour, and fault symptom. As a result, two types of portrait models (i.e., attribute and behaviour feature model and fault symptom feature model) can be constructed. Besides, different model update mechanisms should be developed to update equipment portrait dynamically and periodically. Third, the similarity between source cases (in the established sub-case library) and target cases can be calculated to obtain the best similar cases, which can be further adjusted and optimised to match and generate the final OM scheme for the target products. Meanwhile, the new case should be updated in the original case library.\n\nApplication services of personalised OM are responsible for encapsulating multi-stage OM service business, including intelligent equipment monitoring, personalised OM service scheme, refined OM service management, and component defect improvement (Component 4 in [Fig. 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#fig0001)). For example, by integrating the historical lifecycle data and the real-time operational status data of complex products, portrait models of the key components can be established and updated to monitor their fault features intelligently. By combining the fault features of individual products and the recommended best similar case in the multi-level OM service library, the personalised OM service scheme for different products can be developed. The refined OM service management can realise the control and management of personnel assignment, [task scheduling](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/task-scheduling \"Learn more about task scheduling from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), spare parts supply, etc. According to the fault features and rules reflected by the portrait model in the OM processes, the weaknesses and defects information of current products can be identified. The information can support improving and updating the next generation of product design.\n\nThe logic and relation of the four components in [Fig. 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#fig0001) are described as follows. Component 1 can provide holistic and consistent data for Component 2 through emerging perceptive technology and xBOM mapping technology. As a result, effective knowledge mining, management and reuse in Component 2 can be achieved. Meanwhile, the real-time OM data of Component 1 provides OEMs with the opportunity to update the label library and equipment portrait dynamically and periodically. Therefore, the accuracy and effectiveness of the pushed OM service cases can be enhanced. In addition, the OM case library and knowledge reusing in Component 2 can provide knowledge support for constructing of label library and equipment portrait model in Component 3, which in turn improves the quality and reliability of generated OM scheme. Through Component 2 and Component 3, various application services related to personalised OM in Component 4 can be carried out.\n\n## 4\\. The solution of POMA-CP based on equipment portrait\n\nAccording to the proposed framework, the key technologies (mainly involving Component 2 and Component 3 in [Fig. 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#fig0001)) are introduced in this section, and as a solution of POMA-CP based on equipment portrait. These technologies include case-based reasoning OM knowledge management and reuse, equipment portrait modelling, and active OM service case-pushing.\n\n### 4.1. Case-based reasoning OM knowledge management and reuse\n\n#### 4.1.1. Multi-level OM service case library establishing\n\nDue to the powerful logical relation processing ability of failure mode & effect analysis (FMEA), it is widely used in fault diagnosis (especially for complex products with thousands of components) \\[[62](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0060)\\]. Generally, the FMEA for all complex product components is unnecessary. Therefore, the fault tree models of the critical components are established to conduct the FMEA in practice. A complete fault tree consists of top events, intermediate events and basic events. Due to the limited space, please refer to \\[[63](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0061),[64](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0062)\\] for more information about the main steps and specific methods for executing the FMEA.\n\nThe fault information and knowledge of complex products or critical components can be analysed and extracted based on the FMEA. To improve the efficiency of knowledge managing and reusing, a method for establishing the multi-level OM service case library based on the [FMEA and](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/failure-mode-and-effect-analysis \"Learn more about FMEA and from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") the extracted fault knowledge is developed in this paper (as seen in [Fig. 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#fig0002)).\n\n![Fig 2](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0736584522001673-gr2.jpg)\n\n1.

The structure for multi-level OM service case library of complex products.\n\nFirst, the complex products are divided into _Z_ critical component systems (represented by _[CCS](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/carbon-capture-and-storage \"Learn more about CCS from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\")<sub>z</sub>_) according to their structure and composition. Second, for the _z_th _CCS<sub>z</sub>_, it is divided into _n_ sub-case library (represented by _SCL<sub>z,i</sub>_, ) according to its _n_ fault category (represented by _FC<sub>z,i</sub>_). Third, in the _i_th _SCL<sub>z,i</sub>_, a number of fault symptoms are included. Assume that a total of _m<sub>i</sub>_ fault symptom keywords (represented by _FSK<sub>z,i,j</sub>_, ) are extracted from the fault symptom. Each OM service case (represented by _CASE<sub>z,i,k</sub>_, ) in the _SCL<sub>z,i</sub>_ corresponds to a fault feature space vector that is composed of multiple _FSK_, and contains the essential attribute of product fault and corresponding maintenance scheme (represented by _MS<sub>z,i,k</sub>_). The method of _FSK_ extracting and _CASE_ representation will be described in the following section in detail.\n\n#### 4.1.2. Case-based reasoning OM knowledge reusing\n\nIn this paper, the _CASE_ is regarded as a basic unit of OM knowledge, and each _CASE_ includes some fault information such as fault locations, categories, symptoms and maintenance measures. Therefore, the accuracy of the _CASE_ information expression will greatly affect the efficiency of OM knowledge reuse. Here, the _CASE_ expression refers to a structured description of the information in the historical _CASE_, which is a method of organising the case information according to a specific format. The _CASE_ for complex products can be defined as a four-tuple, as shown below:(1)where, describes the basic information of the _CASE_ for the complex product _CCS_, including case number, fault time, fault location, and fault [symptom description](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/symptom-description \"Learn more about symptom description from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") text, etc. (_S, E_) is the feature set of the _CASE_, where _S_ is the fault symptom feature vector of _CASE_ and represented as , including the _FSK_ () of _CASE_ and its corresponding weight . _E_ is the attribute label information and behaviour label information of _CASE_, including fault location, operating environment, operating parameters, and represented as . Finally, _Q_ is the fault conclusion, including the information on OM service solutions and evaluation results.\n\nThe method for establishing attribute labels and behaviour labels is illustrated in [Section 4.2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0013). The following content of this section will introduce the extraction method of _FSK_ and the [construction processes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/construction-process \"Learn more about construction processes from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of the fault symptom feature vector of _CASE_.\n\n##### 4.1.2.1. Fault symptom keywords extracting\n\nTo quantitatively express the fault symptom feature vector of the _CASE_ text, the text segmentation operation should be performed on the fault record text to obtain the _FSK_. As the best word segmentation module of Python, the _Jieba_ algorithm is widely used in Chinese text segmentation due to its high accuracy and supporting customised dictionaries and multiple modes \\[[65](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0063)\\].\n\nHowever, for a specific complex industrial product, the existing text segmentation tool is difficult to deal with the professional terms effectively. Therefore, it is necessary to supplement and customise the professional dictionary of _CASE_ before performing the text segmentation operation and then carry out the following operations:\n\n-   1)\n    \n    Based on the constructed professional dictionary of _CASE_, the _Jieba_ tokeniser is used to carry out the text segmentation operation, and the forward maximum [matching algorithm](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/matching-algorithm \"Learn more about matching algorithm from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") is adopted to capture the string as long as possible.\n    \n-   2)\n    \n    Based on the text segmentation operation of _CASE_, the fault feature words set will be obtained by setting a stop word table and eliminating the function words and prepositions in fault record sentences.\n    \n-   3)\n    \n    Extract the feature words used to express the OM service domain knowledge of complex products to construct the _FSK_ lexicon. Then, the Chi-square test is used to judge the correlation between fault categories and words in the _FSK_ lexicon. Finally, the words that have a high correlation with product OM service are extracted as the _FSK_. The calculation process of correlation is described in detail as follows:\n    \n\nFor a specific _CCS<sub>z</sub>_, supposing it contains _n FC<sub>z,i</sub>_, and the _CCS<sub>z</sub>_ has _N CASE_. Specifically, for a fault feature word _T_, regarding whether it contains _T_ and whether it belongs to _FC<sub>z,i</sub>_ as the judging conditions, and four values A, B, C and D are obtained (as shown in [Table 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0002)).\n\nTable 2. The relationships between categories and attributes.\n\n| Feature selection | Belong to _FC<sub>z,i</sub>_ | Not belong to _FC<sub>z,i</sub>_ | Event name |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Contain _T_ | A | B | _A_ + _B_ |\n| Not contain _T_ | C | D | C + D |\n| Total | A + C | _B_ + D | _A_ + B + C + D |\n\nCalculating the theoretical value _E<sub>A</sub>_ and difference value _D<sub>A</sub>_ of A by the following formula:(2)(3)(4)\n\nThe method for calculating the theoretical value and difference value for B, C and D is similar to A. The specific methods are not repeated here. Then, the chi-square value between fault feature word _T_ and _FC<sub>z,i</sub>_ is calculated by using the original hypothesis that _T_ is not correlated with _FC<sub>z,i</sub>_:(5)\n\nAt the same time, the chi-square value of the fault feature word _T_ relative to the whole _CASE_ library of the _CCS<sub>z</sub>_ is calculated:(6)where, represents the probability that the case in the _CASE_ library of the _CCS<sub>z</sub>_ belongs to the _FC<sub>z,i</sub>_. The greater the value , the larger the error for the original hypothesis. That is, the fault feature word _T_ has a strong correlation with the _FC<sub>z,i</sub>_. Subsequently, calculating the chi-square values of all fault feature words according to the abovementioned method and arranging them from large to small. Meanwhile, a certain number of fault feature words are screened according to a preset threshold value. As a result, the _FSK_ lexicon can be established.\n\n##### 4.1.2.2. Fault symptom feature vector constructing of the _case_\n\nThe _i_th _SCL<sub>z,i</sub>_ corresponds to the _i_th _FC<sub>z,i</sub>_ of the _z_th _CCS<sub>z</sub>_ (as seen in [Fig. 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#fig0002)), and the _k_th _CASE<sub>z,i,k</sub>_ is analysed. Therefore, _R_ fault symptom keywords (i.e., ) contained in the case text are first extracted, and then the [vector space model](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/vector-space-models \"Learn more about vector space model from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of the fault symptom feature of the _CASE_ is established. Here, the case text is regarded as a vector space composed of a group of [orthogonal vectors](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/orthogonal-vector \"Learn more about orthogonal vectors from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). The fault symptom feature vector of the _CASE_ is expressed as , () is the _FSK_, is the weight of each _FSK_.\n\nThe weight can be calculated by the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) algorithm. The TF-IDF is a feature weight algorithm based on term frequency, which is used to evaluate the importance of a feature word to a particular text in a file set \\[[66](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0064),[67](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0065)\\]. TF is the word frequency of feature words in a particular text, and IDF measures the importance of a feature word. Therefore, the weight of is expressed as a function of and . The is calculated by:(7)where, refers to the times of occurred in a certain _CASE_, and is the total number of occurred in the _CASE_.\n\nMeanwhile, the is calculated by:(8)where, is the total number of all _CASE_ in the _FC<sub>z,i</sub>_, is the number of _CASE_ that contain in the _FC<sub>z,i</sub>_.\n\nThe weight of is calculated by:(9)\n\nThe greater the value (i.e., TF-IDF value) of , the more important it is to the _CASE_. Based on the obtained weight of each , the feature selection weight of (namely the weight threshold of TF-IDF) is defined and determined by the following equation:(10)\n\nIf , the of the _CASE_ is retained; if , the of the _CASE_ is excluded. Finally, the retained is used to construct the fault symptom feature vector of the _CASE_.\n\nFurthermore, the weight can be further normalised by the following formula:(11)\n\n### 4.2. Equipment portrait modelling and OM service case active pushing\n\n#### 4.2.1. Label library constructing and equipment portrait modelling\n\nA proper label library is significant to establishing an equipment portrait model. Generally, a label is a tuple containing product attributes and values. It can be described as _Label_\\=<_Name: W_\\>, where _name_ indicates the label name, and _W_ is the weight. The type and value of weight are determined by label attributes, including numerical type, interval [data type](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/data-type \"Learn more about data type from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), text type, etc.).\n\n##### 4.2.1.1. Label library designing for complex products\n\nIn view of the characteristics and OM service requirements of complex industrial products, a three dimensions label library (including attribute label, behaviour label and fault symptom label) is designed in this paper. They are briefly introduced as follows:\n\nThe attribute label represents the inherent static attributes of complex products, such as equipment type, manufacturer, rated power, and other information. This information will not change dynamically over time and can be obtained directly from the product database.\n\nThe behaviour label consists of the operational status information of complex products, which may change dynamically with time (e.g., operational time, average failure rate, maintenance times, operational environment). Such labels can be obtained by statistical or logical calculation.\n\nThe fault symptom label is similar to the _FSK_ in [Section 4.1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0008). Such labels may change dynamically over time and can be obtained by analysing and mining complex products’ operational performance record text. For example, the [operational load](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/operational-load \"Learn more about operational load from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") is too high, abnormal wear in the bearing shell, bearing temperature is too high, etc.\n\n##### 4.2.1.2. Portrait modelling for complex products\n\nBased on the label library, an equipment portrait model of complex products can be developed. For the _CCS_ of complex products, the equipment portrait model _M<sub>u</sub>_ can be defined as follows:(12)where (_F<sub>i</sub>, E<sub>i</sub>_) represents the fault category feature vector that corresponds to _FC<sub>i</sub>_ in the _CCS_, each (_F<sub>i</sub>, E<sub>i</sub>_) is associated with a weight _ω<sub>i</sub>_. The weight _ω<sub>i</sub>_ refers to the proportion of the occurred times of _F<sub>i</sub>_ amongst all fault categories in a fixed time window. In particular, only the feature vectors whose weights are greater than the threshold _ω<sub>threshold</sub>_ can appear in the equipment portrait model _M<sub>u</sub>_.\n\nThe fault category feature vector (_F<sub>i</sub>, E<sub>i</sub>_) mainly contains:\n\n-   (1)\n    \n    **Fault symptom feature model _F<sub>i</sub>_**. Considering the name of labels in the fault symptom feature model are dynamical changing, it can be described as:(13)\n    \n\nwhere () is the th fault symptom label; is the weight, which indicates the importance of the fault feature; is the time when the label is added to _F<sub>i</sub>_; is the time when the label is last updated in _F<sub>i</sub>_. The weight consists of the local weight and global weight of the label, which is calculated by the following formula:(14)\n\n-   1)\n    \n    Local weight of the label\n    \n\nThe value of the local weight is determined by the occurred times of fault symptom label in the . To avoid , the local label is redefined as:(15)where indicates the occurred times of label in in the historical OM records.\n\n-   1)\n    \n    Global weight of the label\n    \n\nThe local weight cannot be used to measure the accuracy of different labels in identifying various fault categories. Therefore, the concept of [conditional entropy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/conditional-entropy \"Learn more about conditional entropy from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") is introduced to define the global weight of the label \\[[68](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0066)\\], which is represented by . First, the fault categories set is seen as the information sources which conform to some probability distribution, and the _FC_ and the label are regarded as two [random variables](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/random-variable-xi \"Learn more about random variables from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). Second, the importance of a label to a certain _FC_ is determined by the gain between the information entropy of the fault categories set and the conditional entropy of the label \\[[69](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0067)\\]. Finally, the conditional entropy of the _FC,_ which corresponds to the label, can be calculated by the following formula:(16)where indicates the probability of when the label appears, when the label is determined, . As a result, the above equation can be expressed as:(17)where indicates the number of _FC_ in the fault categories set; indicates the times of in ; indicates the times of in the whole fault categories set.\n\n-   (1)\n    \n    **Attribute and behaviour feature model _E<sub>i</sub>_**. Considering the name of labels for attribute and behaviour feature model is fixed, the occurred times of label do not need to be considered when establishing the . Therefore, the attribute and behaviour feature model can be described as:(18)\n    \n\nwhere () represents the attribute label or behaviour label. It contains detailed information related to the _FC_ and other essential information (such as manufacturer, component number, operational status, [service duration](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/service-duration \"Learn more about service duration from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), operational load, etc.); is the label content.\n\nWhen a label of an abnormal event appears in the OM service abnormal event log text set, it is important to map it to the corresponding FC accurately, and then the personalised and refined OM services can be realised. To achieve this objective, the [conditional probability](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/conditional-probability \"Learn more about conditional probability from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of the abnormal event label belonging to each _FC_ should be first calculated. Then the _FC_ of the abnormal event label is divided into the categories with the highest conditional probability value. The main steps for calculating the conditional probability of the abnormal event label are as follows:\n\n-   1)\n    \n    Given an abnormal event log text as a sample set, where the _FC_ is known. Calculating the conditional probability of each abnormal event label in each _FC_:(19)\n    \n-   2)\n    \n    Assuming that the abnormal event labels of the sample set are independent of each other, the probability of an abnormal event log text with a label belonging to the FCi is calculated by the following formula:(20)P(FCi|attr)\\=P(attr|FCi)P(FCi)P(attr)\n    \n-   3)\n    \n    For all fault categories, the P(attr) can be regarded as a constant, so P(attr) can be removed and P(attr|FCi)P(FCi) can be calculated separately, namely:(21)P(attr|FCi)P(FCi)\\=P(attr1|FCi),P(attr2|FCi),...,P(attrm|FCi)P(FCi)\\=P(FCi)∏j\\=1mP(attrj|FCi)\n    \n-   4)\n    \n    Therefore, the _FC_ of the abnormal event log text is determined as:(22)FC\\=argmaxP(FCi)∏j\\=1mP(attrj|FCi)\n    \n\nThe above method regards the weight of all labels as equal. However, various labels play different roles in different [text classification](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/text-classification \"Learn more about text classification from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") application scenarios. To improve the text classification performance, the TF-IDF algorithm in [Section 4.1.2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0010) is used to calculate the weight of abnormal event text labels for the _CASE_ and carry out the mapping between abnormal event labels and fault categories.\n\nAssume that the abnormal event log text of a _CASE_ has a label attr\\={attr1,attr2,...,attrm}, the term frequency of attrj is calculated by TF(attrj)\\=nj∑i\\=1mni, nj refers to the occurred times of attrj in the abnormal event log text, and ∑i\\=1mni is the total number of the attrj occurred in the _CASE_. Meanwhile, the [inverse document frequency](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/inverse-document-frequency \"Learn more about inverse document frequency from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of attrj in the abnormal event relative to the FCi is calculated by IDF(attrj,FCi)\\=logNiNi,j+1, Ni is the number of cases in the _CASE_ library of the FCi, and Ni,j is the number of cases in the _CASE_ library where FCi contains label attrj.\n\nFor the abnormal event log text that contains the label attr\\={attr1,attr2,...,attrm}, the weight ωi,j of label attrj relative to the FCi is calculated by:(23)ωi,j\\=TF(attrj)\\*IDF(attrj,FCi)\n\nFinally, the _FC_ of the abnormal event log text is identified as:(24)FC\\=argmaxP(FCi)∏j\\=1mP(attrj|FCi)ωi,j\n\n#### 4.2.2. OM service case active pushing and scheme decision-making\n\nDue to the dynamic changing of behaviour label and fault symptom label in the equipment portrait model, real-time monitoring and tracing of the CCS that frequently occurred faults can be achieved. As a result, the reuse of historical OM knowledge can be realised. Based on the dynamic monitoring of _CCS_ and efficient reusing of OM knowledge, an active pushing mechanism for the _CASE_ is proposed. The processes of active pushing of the _CASE_ for complex products are shown in [Fig. 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#fig0003). For each feature item of the equipment portrait model, the similarity between the sub-case library and the target case should be calculated to obtain the best similar cases. Then, the best similar cases are adjusted according to the target case's requirements and the OM service scheme is generated applicable to the target product. The local similarity and global similarity of _CASE_ are involved.\n\n![Fig 3](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0736584522001673-gr3.jpg)\n\n1.

The active pushing processes of complex products’ OM service cases.\n\n##### 4.2.2.1. The local similarity calculation of OM service case\n\nAssuming that the fault category feature vector of _FC<sub>i</sub>_ in equipment portrait model _M<sub>u</sub>_ is (_F<sub>i</sub>, E<sub>i</sub>_). Let CASEFCi\\={CASEFCi,1,CASEFCi,2,....} represents the _SCL_ of _FC<sub>i</sub>_, and CASEFCi,k represents the kth _CASE_ of the _SCL_. Usually, the types of label values for the equipment portrait model mainly include symbols, numerical values, interval numbers and texts. Therefore, to achieve the active pushing of _CASE_ and the refined OM services, it is necessary to calculate the local similarity for different label values. Usually, the label value types for model _E<sub>i</sub>_ are mainly symbols, numerical values and interval numbers, while the label value types for model _F<sub>i</sub>_ are mainly texts.\n\nFor a label attrj, let LS(Eij,CASEFCi,kj) represent the local similarity between model Ei and CASEFCi,k, WEj and WFCj represents the values of Ei and CASEFCi,k, respectively. Meanwhile, let LS(Fij,CASEFCi,kj)represent the local similarity between model Fi and CASEFCi,k. The calculation methods of local similarity for different label value types are introduced as follows.\n\n-   (1)\n    \n    Symbol\n    \n\nSymbol labels usually have a fixed value set, enumerating all possible values for these labels. And each value is represented by an explicit symbol. For example, the value of the label ‘_CNC machine_’ can be _JV_<sub>1</sub>, _JV_<sub>2</sub>, _JV_<sub>3</sub>, _JV_<sub>5</sub>, etc. Then, the local similarity of the symbol label is calculated by:(25)LS(Eij,CASEFCi,kj)\\={1WEj\\=WFCj0WEj≠WFCj\n\n-   (1)\n    \n    Numerical value\n    \n\nLet max(CASEFCij) and min(CASEFCij) represent the maximum value and minimum value of label attrj in the _SCL_ that correspond to the FCi, respectively. Therefore, the local similarity of the numerical value label is calculated by:(26)LS(Eij,CASEFCi,kj)\\=1−|WEj−WFCj|max(CASEFCij)−min(CASEFCij)\n\n-   (1)\n    \n    Interval number\n    \n\nThe upper and lower bounds of the interval are represented by Lj and Hj respectively, and label attrj∈\\[Lj,Hj\\]. Therefore, the local similarity of the interval number label is calculated by:(27)LS(Eij,CASEFCi,kj)\\=1−|WEj−LjHj−Lj−WFCj−LjHj−Lj|\n\n-   (1)\n    \n    Text\n    \n\nText similarity is mainly reflected in the fault symptom feature model Fi. That is, if the label is an evaluation label, the label name is a text type, and the value is the weight of each label. Given Fi and a case S\\={(attr1:η1),...,(attrm:ηm)} in the CASEFCi,k. Only the common labels of Fi and S are considered. Thereby, Fi\\={(attr1F:η1F),...,(attrnumFF:ηnumFF)}, S\\={(attr1FC:η1FC),...,(attrnumFFC:ηnumFFC)}. Let Fij is the jth common label attrjF in Fi, and its similarity is LS(Fij,CASEFCi,kj)\\=ηjF·ηjFC. As a result, the local similarity of text label is calculated by:(28)LS(Fi,CASEFCi,k)\\=∑j\\=1numFηjF·ηjFC\n\n##### 4.2.2.2. The global similarity calculation of OM service case\n\nLocal similarity can only be used to measure the relationship between Fi (or Ei) of equipment portrait model _M<sub>u</sub>_ and the _CASE_. Therefore, the local similarity calculation for different label values has some limitations. For instance, it is difficult to achieve accurate pushing of the _CASE_ and thus difficult to carry out refined OM service. To overcome these limitations, it is necessary to calculate further the global similarity between the (_F<sub>i</sub>, E<sub>i</sub>_) of equipment portrait model _M<sub>u</sub>_ and _CASE_.\n\nConsidering the dynamic changing of the label in _F<sub>i</sub>_ and the missing attribute of the label in _E<sub>i</sub>_, the structure similarity should be involved while calculating the global similarity between (_F<sub>i</sub>, E<sub>i</sub>_) and CASEFCi,k. The global similarity GS(Fi,CASEFCi,k) of the fault symptom feature model _F<sub>i</sub>_ and CASEFCi,k is obtained by summing up the local similarity of the common fault symptom labels of _F<sub>i</sub>_ and CASEFCi,k, and then multiplying the structural similarity:(29)GS(Fi,CASEFCi,k)\\=JS(Fi,CASEFCi,k)·LS(Fi,CASEFCi,k)\\=NFi∩CASEFCi,kNFi∪CASEFCi,k·∑j\\=1numFηjF·ηjFCwhere, JS(Fi,CASEFCi,k) is the structural similarity of _F<sub>i</sub>_ and CASEFCi,k; NFi∩CASEFCi,k is the number of attributes for the [intersection set](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/intersection-set \"Learn more about intersection set from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of _F<sub>i</sub>_ and CASEFCi,k; NFi∪CASEFCi,k is the number of attributes for the union set of _F<sub>i</sub>_ and CASEFCi,k; numF is the number of common fault symptom labels.\n\nIn the same way, the global similarity GS(Ei,CASEFCi,k) between the attribute and behaviour feature model _E<sub>i</sub>_ and the CASEFCi,k is obtained by summing up the local similarity of the common attribute and behaviour labels of _E<sub>i</sub>_ and CASEFCi,k, and then multiplying the structural similarity:(30)GS(Ei,CASEFCi,k)\\=JS(Ei,CASEFCi,k)·∑j\\=1numELS(Eij,CASEFCi,kj)ρj∑j\\=1numEρj\\=NEi∩CASEFCi,kNEi∪CASEFCi,k·∑j\\=1numELS(Eij,CASEFCi,kj)ρj∑j\\=1numEρjwhere, JS(Ei,CASEFCi,k) is the structural similarity of _E<sub>i</sub>_ and CASEFCi,k; NEi∩CASEFCi,k is the number of attributes for the intersection set of _E<sub>i</sub>_ and CASEFCi,k; NEi∪CASEFCi,k is the number of attributes for the union set of _E<sub>i</sub>_ and CASEFCi,k; numE is the number of common attribute and behaviour labels; ρj(j\\=1,2,..,num) is the weight of common label, which is determined by expert experience.\n\nFinally, the global similarity between the (_F<sub>i</sub>, E<sub>i</sub>_) and the CASEFCi,k is calculated by the following formula:(31)GS((Fi,Ei),CASEFCi,k)\\=GS(Fi,CASEFCi,k)·ρF+GS(Ei,CASEFCi,k)·ρEρF+ρEwhere, ρF is the weight of _F<sub>i</sub>_, and ρE is the weight of _E<sub>i</sub>_.\n\nAfter calculating the global similarity between each (_F<sub>i</sub>, E<sub>i</sub>_) of equipment portrait model _M<sub>u</sub>_ and _CASE_ of the _SCL_, the best similar cases that correspond to these fault category feature vectors can be obtained by ranking the similarity from large to small. The higher the similarity value ranked, the more valuable the _CASE_ is for future OM service solutions. Then, a set composed of these best similar cases is formed. These best similar cases will further correspond to a set that consists of some OM service solutions. According to the real-time operational status of complex products, the solutions can be dynamically adjusted (such as deleting, adding, replacing, modifying, etc.). As a result, the final OM service scheme can be generated and actively pushed to the OM service scene. Therefore, auxiliary decision support can be provided for complex products’ personalised and refined OM services. In addition, for the _CASE_ with low similarity, it does not mean that it has no value for OM service decision-making. For example, experienced maintenance personnel can help judge and verify the usefulness of the _CASE_. As a result, the modified _CASE_ according to the abovementioned operations can be updated and added to the _SCL_ to enrich the case library, and to provide more similar cases for OM service decision-making.\n\n## 5\\. A study of the application scenario\n\nThe proposed approach is tested by an application scenario of an industrial partner company. The main objectives of the application scenario study are to test how equipment portrait can be used in the OM service of complex products and what improvements are made by the combined application of equipment portrait and PSS in personalised OM service.\n\nIn this section, an overview of the application scenario is provided. Then, the established methods of the application scenario's multi-level OM service case library are introduced. Third, the active pushing processes of OM service cases for bogie wheelsets of high-speed electric multiple units (EMUs) are elaborated. Finally, the advantages of the proposed POMA-CP based on equipment portrait within the PSS mode are analysed and discussed.\n\n### 5.1. Overview of the application scenario\n\nThe partner company is a rail transit equipment manufacturer in China which focuses on the R&D, manufacturing, service and maintenance support of high-end railway equipment. The company has manufactured over 10,000 trains in varieties. These trains include high-speed EMUs, intercity EMUs, and urban rail vehicles used by more than 18 railway companies across China. Because the company's trains are mainly used in the passenger transport area, it is of [utmost importance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/utmost-importance \"Learn more about utmost importance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") for the company to prevent faults and ensure safety and reliability. In recent years, the company has developed and manufactured a series of new high-speed EMUs with a top speed of 350 km/h and 400 km/h.\n\nBogie is one of the important components to realise the running task of a high-speed EMU, which has a lifespan of over 20–30 years. It is responsible for guidance, [vibration reduction](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/vibration-reduction \"Learn more about vibration reduction from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), traction, braking and other tasks of the EMUs. The maintenance of the bogie and its key components in a timely and accurate manner directly determines the operational performance and safety of the EMU \\[[70](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0068)\\]. Therefore, it has high quality and maintenance service requirements. In addition, the bogie also has the characteristics of a complex structure. For example, the bogie generally consists of a wheelset, axle box, [bogie frame](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/bogie-frame \"Learn more about bogie frame from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), mechanical drive unit, foundation brake rigging, primary suspension, secondary suspension, etc. Each component is made up of thousands of parts. Meanwhile, all the abovementioned tasks of the EMU need to be realised by the complex movement relations between different components of the bogie. Therefore, the EMU bogie is a typical complex product. [Fig. 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#fig0004) is a schematic diagram of the H38L (a virtual name used in this paper) high-speed EMU bogie manufactured by the partner company.\n\n![Fig 4](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0736584522001673-gr4.jpg)\n\n1.

The schematic diagram of the H38L high-speed EMU bogie.\n\nIn the past, since local railway companies operated the EMUs in different geographical areas, the operational status data of EMU and their critical components in diverse conditions could not be acquired accurately and completely. As a result, the efficiency of OM service schemes for EMU based on incomplete and inaccurate operational status data was lower, which has directly affected the safety and service life of EMU. Meanwhile, the knowledge that affects fault analysis and service decision-making is difficult to reuse due to the unreasonable organisation and management of historical OM knowledge. This has made active pushing of OM service cases extremely difficult to realise.\n\nTherefore, it is important to determine how to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of OM service cases pushing and schemes decision-making for EMU to improve safety and reliability, which was the main challenge the partner company faced for a long period. Recently, with the rapid advancement of portrait technology and the wide application of PSS mode, the company sought a new way to achieve the potential of applying the lifecycle data and historical OM knowledge of EMUs for fault analysis and OM scheme decision-making and to transform its manufacturing mode from the product-driven pattern to the system-integration and the service-driven one. Therefore, they tested the novel approach according to [Section 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0006). The proposed approach was tested and followed the combination of quantitative and qualitative methods based on case analysis and semi-structured interviews.\n\n### 5.2. Establishing of bogie multi-level OM service case library\n\nThe failure reporting analysis and corrective action system (FRACAS) is the main tool developed by the partner company and its service providers to manage the OM data of EMUs within the service-driven manufacturing mode. In the FRACAS, the fault record data of the operation process and maintenance site for the geographically scattered EMU are included, which is analysed in this paper to excavate the fault information of bogie. The fault information of the EMU bogie is automatically triggered by the activation of an alarm function that setting in the FRACAS.\n\nThe FRACAS can record multiple fields related to EMU fault information (e.g., date of fault, EMU number, fault description, fault cause, fault effect, troubleshooting measure, responsible department, etc.). Based on this information, the working principle and operating environment of the EMU are further aligned to construct the fault system of the EMU bogie (as shown in [Table 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0003)).\n\nTable 3. The fault system of EMU bogie.\n\n| **Critical component system fault** | **Sub-system fault** | **Parts fault** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| The EMU bogie | Wheelset | Wheel tread fault |\n| Wheel flange wearing |\n| Axle fault |\n| Brake disc fault |\n| Axle box and locating device | Axle box damage |\n| Axle box bearing failure |\n| Axle end-cover fault |\n| Axial positioning device fault |\n| Bogie frame | Frame weld opening, frame crack |\n| Frame deformation |\n| Mechanical drive unit | Gearbox fault |\n| Shaft coupling fault |\n| Traction motor fault |\n| Foundation brake unit | Brake pad fault |\n| Balance slide bar failure |\n| Bellow break |\n| Brake disc crack |\n| Brake cylinder fault |\n| Primary suspension | Axle box spring failure |\n| Rubber mat falling off |\n| Vertical damper fault |\n| Secondary suspension | Air spring fault |\n| Levelling valve fault |\n| Differential pressure valve fault |\n| Anti-roll bar fault |\n| Lateral damper fault |\n\nBased on the EMU bogie fault system in [Table 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0003), the bogie's structure and failure mode are analysed by applying [FMEA](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/failure-mode-analysis \"Learn more about FMEA from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") to construct the fault tree model of the EMU bogie (as shown in [Fig. 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#fig0005)). The symbol and definition of each event in the fault tree model are shown in [Table 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0004).\n\n![Fig 5](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0736584522001673-gr5.jpg)\n\n1.

Moreover, the text processing method in [Section 4.1.2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0010) is adopted to extract the _FSK_ and the possible fault causes of each sub-case library. Finally, a multi-level OM service case library is obtained. Detailed information is given in [Table 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0010) of the Appendix. Based on the bogie's multi-level OM service case library, the method in [Section 4.1.2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0010) is used to define and express the OM service case. As a result, the bogie OM service case structure can be represented as a table (as shown in [Table 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0005)).\n\nTable 5. The structure of the bogie OM service case.\n\n<table><tbody><tr><td id=\"en0210\" rowspan=\"5\">Basic information on the OM case</td><td id=\"en0211\" colspan=\"2\">Case number</td></tr><tr><td id=\"en0213\" colspan=\"2\">Sub-case library</td></tr><tr><td id=\"en0215\" colspan=\"2\">Fault occurrence time</td></tr><tr><td id=\"en0217\" colspan=\"2\">Fault occurrence location</td></tr><tr><td id=\"en0219\" colspan=\"2\">Fault symptom description text</td></tr><tr><td id=\"en0220\" rowspan=\"5\">Feature set of OM case</td><td id=\"en0221\" colspan=\"2\">Fault symptom feature vector</td></tr><tr><td id=\"en0223\" rowspan=\"4\">Attribute and behaviour feature vector</td><td id=\"en0224\">Train type</td></tr><tr><td id=\"en0227\">Train marshalling number</td></tr><tr><td id=\"en0230\">Train number</td></tr><tr><td id=\"en0233\">Carriage number…</td></tr><tr><td id=\"en0234\" rowspan=\"3\">Fault conclusion information</td><td id=\"en0235\" colspan=\"2\">Fault handling time</td></tr><tr><td id=\"en0237\" colspan=\"2\">Fault handling personnel</td></tr><tr><td id=\"en0239\" colspan=\"2\">Suggested solution</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\nThe suggested solution in [Table 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0005) is provided in text form through the OM service structured document platform that was developed in the FRACAS, where the information on bogie structure trees, maintenance types, and maintenance operation structured files can be presented. In particular, the detailed operation instructions of the suggested solution text can be provided in the maintenance operation structured files. For example, the information in maintenance operation structured files mainly includes maintenance task name, operation number, personnel and labour-hour, task description, spare parts, operation instruction text, etc. According to this information, maintenance instructions can be provided for field personnel.\n\n[Table 6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0006) shows an example of the original record of an EMU bogie OM service case. Based on the original case record, fault categories can be analysed and judged by the method of fault symptom keywords extracted introduced in [Section 4.1.2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0010). Finally, the OM service cases are expressed and managed by the structure represented in [Table 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0005), as shown in [Table 7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0007). This mode can be further used to provide knowledge support for the active pushing of personalised OM service schemes for bogie and to promote the achievement of knowledge reuse.\n\nTable 6.

Active pushing of OM service cases for bogie wheelset\n\nTaking the wheelset of the bogie for the H38L high-speed EMU as an example, the feasibility and effectiveness of the active pushing method of OM service cases are verified in this section. Given the equipment portrait model of the bogie is _M<sub>u</sub>_\\= {(_F_<sub>1</sub>, _E_<sub>1</sub>): _ω_<sub>1</sub>, (_F_<sub>2</sub>, _E_<sub>2</sub>): _ω_<sub>2</sub>, …, (_F<sub>n</sub>, E<sub>n</sub>_): _ω<sub>n</sub>_}, and assumed that (_F_<sub>1</sub>, _E_<sub>1</sub>) represents the fault category feature vector of the wheelset. When a certain fault of the wheelset occurred, the FRACAS will extract the portrait model of the wheelset and the sub-case library that corresponds to this fault type. Then, the similarity calculation instruction will be further triggered in the FRACAS to calculate the similarity between the fault category feature vector and OM service case in the sub-case library to get the best similarity cases. The best similar case corresponds to an OM service solution of the fault type for the bogie wheelset. Therefore, the suggested solution text should be extracted from the previously established OM service case library based on the occurred fault type.\n\nIn this application scenario, the fault feature vector of the wheelset in the target case is expressed as _F_<sub>1</sub>\\= {wheel tread scrape: 0.5, wheel indentation depth transfinite: 0.3, wheel wear: 0.2}. Furthermore, the attribute and behaviour feature vector are expressed as _E_<sub>1</sub>\\= {TT: H38L, TN: G372, TMN: 3736, CN: 02, mileage: 160,782, EAT: 27, TC: hills, RF or SF: yes, FC: wheelset fault, FP: wheel tread}. [Table 8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0008) shows the cases related to the fault case library of the EMU bogie wheelset. Meanwhile, [Table 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0011) of the Appendix shows the value types of the feature items of the EMU bogie fault case library.\n\nTable 8. Cases related to the fault case library of bogie wheelset.\n\n| **Feature items** | **Case 1** | **Case 2** | **Case 3** | **Case 4** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **F** | FSFV | {wheel rim crack: 0.7, wear: 0.3} | {wear: 0.3, sparking: 0.35, brake shoe deformation: 0.25} | {wheel tread scrape: 0.4, abnormal noise: 0.35, wear: 0.25} | {wheel tread scrape: 0.15, wheel tread peeling: 0.85} |\n| **E** | TT | H380L | H40F | H38L | H30C |\n| TN | G372 | G506 | G434 | G650 |\n| TMN | 3651 | 3013 | 3782 | 3023 |\n| CN | 02 | 06 | 03 | 07 |\n| Mi/km | 113,500 | 57,805 | 191,421 | 132,560 |\n| EAT/ °C | 12 | 20 | 30 | 26 |\n| TC | Hills | Plain | Plain | Hills |\n| RF or SF | No | No | Yes | Yes |\n| FC | Wheelset fault | Wheelset fault | Wheelset fault | Wheelset fault |\n| FP | Wheel rim | Wheel tread | Wheel tread | Wheel tread |\n| **Suggested solution** | This fault is caused by local material fatigue. If the wheel rim crack is not more than 80 mm, the train can directly run to the destination after inspecting and affirming by manage department. If the crack exceeds 80 mm, the carriage should be disengaged from the train immediately to ensure the safety of the whole EMU. | This fault is caused by the poor material of the brake pad. For example, the adhesive, filler or auxiliary material does not conform to regulation. The rail transit equipment company should strictly screen their suppliers and control the quality of parts. | The wheel tread scrape and wear are caused by the failure of the electronic antiskid device due to the excessive braking force of the train. The wheel lathe needs to be replaced and trimmed to the circular. Then repair the electronic antiskid device to work properly and avoid the wheel scrape. The fixed frequency abnormal noise is caused by local depression of the wheel tread due to the too-soft material of the wheelset and foreign object impact. This problem needs to be fed back to the wheelset supplier to adjust the material. | This fault is related to the material's low yield and tensile strength. The wheelset needs to be replaced. Then the wheel lathe needs to be trimmed to improve the smelting quality and to reduce the metal wear caused by tread peeling. |\n\nBy using the similarity calculation method in [Section 4.2.2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0017), four cases in [Table 8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0008) are matched. Meanwhile, the weight value of each feature item is {0.5, 0.05, 0.03, 0.01, 0.01, 0.1, 0.04, 0.03, 0.03, 0.1, 0.1}. That is, the weight ρF of _F_<sub>1</sub> is 0.5, and the weight ρE of _E_<sub>1</sub> is 0.5. Meanwhile, set the mileage range to \\[0, 1,800,000\\], the lower limit of operation environment temperature is −30 °C, and the upper limit is 40 °C. Finally, the case matching results ranked from high to low by global similarity is shown in [Table 9](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0009).\n\nTable 9. The OM case matching results.\n\n| The case number | The global similarity of case |\n| --- | --- |\n| Case 3 | 0.8165 |\n| Case 4 | 0.7158 |\n| Case 1 | 0.6971 |\n| Case 2 | 0.6372 |\n\nAs seen in [Table 9](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0009), Case 3 has the greatest global similarity. Therefore, Case 3 can be suggested and considered the best similar case for the target product, and its solution has the most reference value. And the solution of Case 3 can be pushed to field personnel, and then the OM service for the wheelset can be carried out following the generated maintenance operation structured files. However, the fault contained in the solution of case 3 is different from the target product. For example, there is no abnormal noise problem for the target product. Thereby, the personalised OM service solution for the target product does not contain measures for [noise cancellation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/noise-cancellation \"Learn more about noise cancellation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). That is, the suggested solution should be adjusted according to the actual OM situation through artificial intervention. As a result, the adjusted OM service scheme is replacing the wheel lathe and trimming it to the circular, repairing the electronic antiskid device to work normally, and avoiding the wheel scrape.\n\nThe above-mentioned processes illustrated that the way for the personnel to confirm or dismiss the usefulness of the suggested solution is involved and considered in the application scenario study. According to the method and process described in [Section 4.2.2.2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0019), experienced maintenance personnel will intervene in the judgement and [verification processes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/verification-process \"Learn more about verification processes from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of the usefulness of the OM service case. As a result, the edited and adjusted OM service case will be dynamically updated to the sub-case library. Therefore, if the suggested solution is not the right one, the FRACAS will generate and recommend the new solution through the OM service structured document platform based on personnel confirming and editing the solution content. The interviews confirmed that the partner company adopts the human-based manner to improve operational decision-making in maintenance service delivery processes based on the actual OM service situation. Feedback to improve and adjust the system-based solution proposal for the introduction of new ones according to the actual maintenance task is necessary.\n\n### 5.4. Analysis and discussions\n\nThe study of the application scenario provides strong evidence that the proposed approach is valid and feasible, which indicates that it has the potential to be applied in the industry field for product OM services. Compared with other research \\[[25](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0024),[26](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0025),[30](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0029)\\], the major difference is the novel combination of PSS and portrait technology with the possibility of acquiring more comprehensive lifecycle data and the advantage of describing personalised user requirements and providing refined product services.\n\nThe proposed novel POMA-CP based on equipment portrait within the PSS mode makes it possible to access the product data of different [lifecycle stages](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/lifecycle-stage \"Learn more about lifecycle stages from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and trace the business data of different stakeholders. For example, the product data at the beginning of life (design and manufacturing stages), middle of life (operation, service and maintenance stages) and end of life (remanufacturing, recycling, reuse), and the business data scattered in OEMs, component suppliers, maintenance service providers, product operators, etc. These data create effective means to enable inter-connect user needs, personalised OM and sustainable competitive advantage. For example, the abovementioned data can be analysed to construct the fine-grained label library and accurate portrait model to manage better and maintain complex products while improving different stakeholders’ business processes and decisions. As a result, the complex products can be run in a better state, thereby enhancing customer satisfaction and promoting user buyback and [user experience](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/user-experience \"Learn more about user experience from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). This would be a potential competitive advantage for OEMs and service providers.\n\nThe proposed approach, along with the multi-source data of different lifecycle stages and stakeholders, allows the service providers to find more hidden fault features and match more precise OM service schemes in a shorter time. This will contribute service providers to reducing maintenance costs and resource consumption, OEMs optimising product design and [manufacturing process](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/production-process \"Learn more about manufacturing process from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), and product users reducing safety risks caused by a sudden failure. Therefore, the PSS mode, rich data, and personalised OM approach are three significant pillars for exploring the potential of the equipment portrait for complex products. These three elements provide insights to service providers and OEMs to develop and implement [sustainable business models](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/sustainable-business-model \"Learn more about sustainable business models from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") in line with corporate social responsibility.\n\nAccording to the semi-structured interviews with the managers of the partner company, in the past, even though mainly operational data of the critical components for EMU bogie were collected and analysed, the deviation between the maintenance decision and task execution is often produced. This is mainly caused by the dynamic changing of bogie operational status, fuzzy relationship, and inconsistent data transmission amongst different lifecycle stages and stakeholders. By applying the novel OM approach with multi-source lifecycle data and dynamic attribute and behaviour label library, more fault features and knowledge were found to conduct targeted analysis on bogie's operational status and performance. Therefore, personalised, refined and active OM services can be carried out to ensure the safety and reliability of EMU. This can move the service providers from planned [corrective maintenance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/corrective-maintenance \"Learn more about corrective maintenance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") to proactive and condition-based OM service planning [\\[6\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#bib0006), reducing the service providers’ [OM costs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/operation-and-maintenance-cost \"Learn more about OM costs from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and ensuring the customers’ safety. The managers of the partner company also emphasised that the schemes of the bogie OM service case for frequent faults can provide new ideas and insights for research and development of the next generation of the EMU bogie. Moreover, other potential benefits of the novel approach, such as the personalised and refined OM service for [product families](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/product-family \"Learn more about product families from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), can be realised because of the rich portrait models.\n\n## 6\\. Conclusions\n\nMany manufacturing enterprises of complex products have transformed their businesses towards PSS modes and have integrated user portraits with relevant OM services, which helps accelerate the transition of service mode to refined, differentiated, [personalised services](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/personalized-service \"Learn more about personalised services from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). As a result, the concept of equipment portrait has received increasing attention in complex products’ OM service studies. Meanwhile, the opportunities for OEMs to accurately describe personalised user demands by comprehensive collecting the data of PSS delivery processes for complex products are continuously increasing. However, with the [permeation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/permeation \"Learn more about permeation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and application of portrait technology in industrial and complex products’ OM service fields, OEMs are facing many challenges. For example, how should a prescriptive procedure for equipment portrait-based OM service delivery and execution processes of industrial complex products be structured, and how to effectively organise and reuse the knowledge extracted from the PSS delivery process data to support equipment portrait-based OM service decision-making?\n\nIn order to address the challenges, in this paper, a novel framework and solution of POMA-CP based on equipment portrait within the PSS mode was proposed. First, the proposed POMA-CP framework contributes to the research related to the investigation of a prescriptive and structured process for the implementation of the equipment portrait-based OM service decision-making. The framework answers RQ1 by guiding the industrial practitioners in exploiting data generated during the whole PSS delivery lifecycle to improve and optimise the OM service delivery and execution processes (e.g., personalised and refined OM service), then addressing one of the knowledge gaps identified from existing literature (as stated in paragraph 2 of [Section 2.3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0005)). Second, another knowledge gap identified from the literature review existed in the lack of approaches proposed for exploiting the integrated application of equipment portrait and PSS (as stated in paragraph 3 of [Section 2.3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0005)). The solution of POMA-CP contributes to addressing this gap and answers RQ2 by introducing a set of methods in each component aimed at organizing and managing the knowledge excavated from PSS delivery processes data to establish a precise portrait model, and support the industrial practitioners in personalised and refined OM service decision-making.\n\nThe limitations of this paper are summarised as follows. First, in the application scenario, only one case record (see [Table 6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0006)) and one bogie (see [Table 8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0008)) for a specific EMU was used to test the effectiveness of the active pushing mechanism of the OM service solution. To strengthen the applicability and robustness of the proposed approach, different components for this application scenario and different types of EMU bogies as well as different operational conditions (or case records) should be considered and tested comprehensively. Second, when organising and expressing the OM service case of EMU bogie, only ten mainly features (see [Table 7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#tbl0007)) that reflect bogie fault features were selected to construct the attribute and behaviour feature vector. In order to improve the efficiency and accuracy of case matching, more features should be selected and considered to enrich the case library's information and provide more fine-grained information or knowledge for personalised and refined OM services. Third, the system-based and human-based manner are combined together in the application scenario study to generate the best similarity cases and to suggest the final OM service solutions. However, the validation test comparing human-based and system-based solution proposals and the time required to evaluate the proposed solution were not performed in this work.\n\nFuture research will focus on the following three aspects. First, the labels used to establish the equipment portrait model will dynamically change along with the different operational conditions of complex products. Therefore, a periodic updating mechanism (as stated in [Section 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0006)) of the equipment portrait model should be investigated to implement more refined OM services. Second, with the ever-increasing accumulation of equipment operational data and OM service abnormal event log text, more advanced algorithms should be considered to improve the accuracy of fault symptom keywords extracting and fault cause identification (as stated in [Section 4.2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0013)). Third, more abundant similarity calculation methods for different types of label values (as stated in [Section 4.2.2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#sec0017)) should be developed and involved to maximise historical OM service knowledge's [reusability](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/reusability \"Learn more about reusability from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and enhance the precision of OM service case-pushing and scheme decision-making.\n\n## CRediT authorship contribution statement\n\n**Shan Ren:** Writing – original draft, Methodology, Software. **Lichun Shi:** Methodology, Software. **Yang Liu:** Supervision, Validation, Writing – review & editing. **Weihua Cai:** [Data curation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/data-curation \"Learn more about Data curation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). **Yingfeng Zhang:** Supervision, Validation.\n\n## Declaration of Competing Interest\n\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. [52005408](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#gs0001) and [U2001201](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#gs0001)) and the Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi ([2021GY-069](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736584522001673#gs0002)).\n\n## Appendix\n\nTable A.1.

T…\n\n---\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nComponents in civil infrastructure systems, such as bridges, pipes, and electric wires, deteriorate over the life cycle of the systems due to corrosion of materials and other environmental factors. Component failures caused by the degradation may trigger a system-level failure event, e.g., [power outage](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/power-outage \"Learn more about power outage from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), service disruption, loss of network connectivity, or degenerate the systems’ the quality of service (QoS) like usability and [serviceability](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/serviceability \"Learn more about serviceability from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") [\\[1\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0001). Since civil infrastructure systems, especially lifeline systems including power, water, or gas transmission systems, have a great impact on [modern societies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/modern-society \"Learn more about modern societies from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), not only can each failure cause huge socio-economic losses, but system-level malfunctions multiply the damage exponentially. To quantify the risk uncertainty of these system elements, numerous studies on risk modeling based on stochastic processes have been conducted \\[[2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0002),[3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0003)\\]. Based on these modeled risk, decision-makers should establish apposite risk-informed operation and maintenance (O&M) policies considering the inevitable changes in system-level QoS and the consequences of system failure \\[[2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0002),[4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0004)\\].\n\nVarious O&M strategies have been developed for structures in civil lifeline systems. For example, time-based maintenance (TBM) undertakes maintenance based on the predetermined repair time intervals, i.e., without monitoring or criteria evaluation \\[[5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0005),[6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0006)\\]. On the other hand, condition-based maintenance (CBM) aims to perform [preventive maintenance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/preventive-maintenance \"Learn more about preventive maintenance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") based on the information acquired or interpreted in various forms \\[[6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0006),[7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0007),[8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0008),[9](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0009)\\]. Although it is straightforward to scale and apply these O&M schemes to multiple components, the introduction of exogenous variables such as the cost of system failure events hampers their direct extensions to system-level decision-making processes. This is because component-level [optimality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/optimality \"Learn more about optimality from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") does not ensure the optimal decisions at the system level [\\[10\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0010). Therefore, stakeholders and decision-makers of civil lifeline systems should be able to establish an O&M policy based on the system-level performance rather than on the conditions of individual components during the life cycle.\n\nFor O&M policy planning for a system consisting of components subject to uncertain failures, classical theories of system reliability \\[[11](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0011),[12](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0012),[13](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0013)\\] often introduce a Markovian model to handle the characteristics of the components and the system. If the same system control policy is applied over the life cycle, stationary conditions are achieved after a warm-up period. Thus, the system availability can be expressed as a closed-form expression under the assumption that components have constant mean failure rates [\\[13\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0013). However, such an O&M policy based on the steady-state assumption is not flexible enough to cope with many plausible exceptions in practice, e.g., an old road facing its service life.\n\nIn efforts to obtain optimal O&M decisions without special assumptions such as steady-state conditions in a finite time horizon, a [Markov decision process](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/markov-decision-process \"Learn more about Markov decision process from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") (MDP) has been considered as a preferred framework to formulate the stochastic processes of [structural deterioration](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/structural-deterioration \"Learn more about structural deterioration from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and the risk-informed O&M optimization. Because of the capability to quantify the expected cost or value of various maintenance actions in each state through [dynamic programming](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/dynamic-programming \"Learn more about dynamic programming from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), MDPs have been applied to establish the O&M policies for multi-state systems \\[[14](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0014),[15](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0015)\\] as well as component-level policies [\\[16\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0016) for civil infrastructures. Although MDPs have a fundamental limit in direct applications to large systems due to the curse of dimensionality, i.e., the state and action spaces increase exponentially with the number of the components, researchers have proposed relaxing constraints or seeking approximate solutions \\[[17](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0017),[18](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0018)\\].\n\nIn particular, to overcome the challenges, recent studies have applied many deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithms \\[[19](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0019),[20](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0020),[21](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0021),[22](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0022)\\] to maintenance optimization problems in civil infrastructure systems \\[[23](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0023),[24](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0024),[25](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0025)\\]. More specifically, Yang et al. [\\[26\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0026) utilized a deep Q-learning (DQN) framework for the optimal CBM planning of a multi-state system, and the framework has been further refined with the introduction of double DQN (DDQN) \\[[27](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0027),[28](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0028),[29](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0029)\\]. Moreover, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) \\[[30](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0030),[31](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0031),[32](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0032),[33](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0033)\\], in which multiple agents learn policies to achieve the minimum costs using DRL, has been considered to improve the scalability of DRL applications for optimizing the maintenance of civil systems. For example, Andriotis and Papakonstantinou \\[[10](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0010),[34](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0034)\\] have developed centralized or decentralized MARL-based algorithms, respectively, in terms of sharing or not sharing parameters related to each agent's policy for large civil systems. Zhou et al. [\\[35\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0035) also proposed MARL-based hierarchical algorithms to optimize the O&M decisions of large-scale multi-component systems. To enhance the performance of MARL, Nguyen et al. [\\[36\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0036) introduced a value decomposition network (VDN) algorithm \\[[32](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0032),[37](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0037)\\], decomposing the centralized Q-value into the sum of decentralized Q-values defined for individual agents, to find the best O&M decisions. However, although these MARL algorithms successfully reduce the computational complexity, model training or hyperparameter tuning still requires considerable time even in the relaxed environment. In the numerical examples where the existing MARL methods are applied, the topologies are quite monotonous, such as series- or parallel-systems, and the number of components is also limited.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a parallelized multi-agent deep Q-network (PM-DQN), a divide-and-conquer algorithm that utilizes clustering-based multi-scale approaches \\[[38](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0038),[39](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0039)\\], for risk-informed decision optimization of multi-state flow systems by combining the system simplification with MARL based on parallel processing. In PM-DQN, the agents observe the states of multiple subsystems identified by clustering, and learn decentralized policies to minimize the factorized cost for subsystems. The algorithm guides the decentralized policies chosen by the agents toward the system-level optimality by repeating the learning process through parallel processing and tuning a key hyperparameter based on the results with less computational cost. As a result, the PM-DQN can efficiently manage large systems that are out of control in existing approaches.\n\nThis paper is organized as follows. [Section 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0002) provides a description of the problem setting and the model assumptions for numerical examples, discusses the system-level sequential decision-making optimization problem, and introduces the DDQN and MARL frameworks. [Section 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0010) proposes the PM-DQN algorithm based on the configuration of subsystems based on community detection and the cost factorization. The efficiency and superior performance of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated by numerical examples in [Section 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0014), followed by a summary and concluding remarks in [Section 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0017).\n\n## 2\\. Background information\n\n### 2.1. Problem statement\n\n#### 2.1.1. Descriptions of system state\n\nIn this study, we consider a multi-state flow system with components. It is assumed that the initial state of each component is intact, i.e., as-good-as-new (AGAN) state. The degradation level of components is identified as one of the following discretized damage states through annual observations: _AGAN, slight damage, moderate damage, extensive damage,_ and _collapse_. We assume that the system state is observed without errors. The [system degradation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/degradation-system \"Learn more about system degradation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") state is given as a vector of component states, where is the state of component at time\n\nAs a performance indicator, the maximum flow capacity between two predetermined terminals is used to quantify the QoS of the system. It is assumed that the flow capacity of all components depends on each state as shown in [Table 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#tbl0001). Once the flow capacities of all components are determined, i.e., the system state is observed, the loss of the system QoS, can be calculated as the difference between the current maximum flow capacity and the maximum flow capacity under the initial system state through the max-flow algorithm \\[[1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0001),[40](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0040),[41](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0041)\\]. Depending on the topology of the system, each component's flow capacity loss due to the deterioration has a different effect on the QoS of the system.\n\nTable 1. Flow capacity of each component for each damage state.\n\n| Damage state | AGAN | Slight | Moderate | Extensive | Collapse |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Flow Capacity | 1.00 | 0.95 | 0.50 | 0.25 | 0 |\n\n#### 2.1.2. Descriptions of maintenance and degradation process\n\nBased on the system state information, the agent chooses one of the two options for O&M action for the component at time i.e., ‘Do Nothing (_DN_)’ and ‘Repair it to AGAN state (_R_).’ System-level action is defined as a vector of the actions taken for individual components. Although the size of the action space seems small at the component level, the number of system-level actions that a decision-maker considers each year is which increases exponentially with the number of components.\n\nWe assume that there is no limit to the number of components that can be repaired per step. When the decision-maker selects _R_ for one component, the state becomes the AGAN state deterministically, otherwise it remains the same or deteriorates with a certain probability called state-transition probability The stochastic [degradation process](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/degradation-process \"Learn more about degradation process from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of individual components is modeled as an independent discrete-time Markov process. That is, the state-transition probability for component depends only on the current state and action due to its [Markov properties](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/markov-property \"Learn more about Markov properties from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). While the state-transition probabilities for _R_ are the same for all components, the state-transition probabilities for _DN_ are modeled in two ways depending on the component types, each shown as matrices in the [Appendix A](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0019). Once the system-level action for all components is determined in system state we can define the system-level state-transition probability based on the state-transition probabilities for all components.\n\n#### 2.1.3. Descriptions of operation and maintenance costs\n\nIn the O&M process of civil lifeline systems, various variables (e.g., maintenance costs, system QoS, component malfunction) must be considered simultaneously at each time step. Because of trade-offs between life-cycle costs and the risk of systems, there is often no single solution that optimizes all these variables simultaneously. It is necessary to find an appropriate compromise among the conflicting goals. In multi-objective optimization, one can explore Pareto-optimal solutions that cannot improve an objective function without degrading other objective functions [\\[42\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0042). However, to make a decision among Pareto-optimal solutions, the subjective preference of decision-makers must intervene inevitably.\n\nOne can handle this issue by transforming multiple objective functions into a single objective function through scalarization, i.e., the weighted sum formulation. In this approach, the optimal solution strongly depends on cost functions (or utility functions) used in the scalarization process. In this paper, the objective function which is the total cost at time is defined as the sum of the multiple objective functions scaled to cost as follows:(1)where is the maintenance cost for the component is the cost due to the shutdown of the component and is the system damage cost caused by the loss of system QoS. In [Eq. (1)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0001), conflicts with the other operation costs; and which depend on the state of components and system, decrease with a conservative O&M decision, while incurred by repairs increases. Therefore, a suitable compromise between these costs is desirable.\n\nIn numerical examples in [Section 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0014), it is assumed that the maintenance cost of 1.0 is imposed when is _R_ regardless of and the shutdown cost of 1.0 is charged when component reached the collapse state. Loss of the system QoS, penalizes the system damage cost by a factor of as(2)where is a function representing the maximum flow capacity between predetermined two terminals under system state and is the initial system state vector, i.e., every component is in AGAN state.\n\nIf the term in [Eq. (1)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0001) is neglected, i.e., the objective function is given as a linear function of the component-level costs, the system-level optimization problem is decomposed into multiple component-level optimization problems. The optimal solutions to the [subproblems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/subproblem \"Learn more about subproblems from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") provide the system-level optimum. In most cases, however, given as a function of component state combinations is of great interest. Therefore, the objective function cannot be decomposed into component-level decentralized costs. In other words, the number of combinable policies to explore for achieving a system-level optimal solution grows exponentially with the system size.\n\n### 2.2. System-level sequential maintenance optimization\n\nIn maintenance optimization problems for civil lifeline system, the agent's goal is to determine a policy as a mapping from the state to the action to minimize the Q-value, defined as the expected total discounted costs to the system's lifespan as(3)where is the discount factor to convert future costs into present values. Just as the component-level [optimality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/optimality \"Learn more about optimality from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") does not guarantee the system-level optimality, a greedy optimal decision at every time step cannot assure optimality over the long run in a finite-time horizon environment. This applies to sequential maintenance optimization problems for civil lifeline system O&M throughout the life cycle. An O&M policy is defined to be better than or equal to another O&M policy if and only if its expected cost is smaller than or equal to that of for all states [\\[43\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0043). That is, the optimal O&M policy leads the Q-value to its minimum.\n\nIn value iteration \\[[43](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0043),[44](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0044)\\], considering this point, the Q-value is updated by continuously choosing the action with the lowest Q-value as(4)\n\nAfter initializing all the Q-value estimates to zero, the values are updated iteratively according to the following Bellman equation:(5)where is the Q-value on state and action estimated at the iteration. The value [iteration algorithm](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/iteration-algorithm \"Learn more about iteration algorithm from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") works well in simple environments but does not apply to environments with large state and action spaces. In particular, evaluating the Q-value of every combinable state-action pair in complex environments is nearly impossible.\n\n### 2.3. Double Deep Q-Network with prioritized experience replay\n\nTo overcome the computational limitation, Watkins and Dayan [\\[22\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0022) proposed to apply a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm called Q-learning. In the Q-learning algorithm, instead of [Eq. (5)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0005), the following equation is used to update Q-values iteratively:(6)where is the learning rate; and is the target value.\n\nThe \\-greedy algorithm is often implemented to expedite the exploration and exploitation process for Q-learning [\\[43\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0043). In detail, after initializing Q-value to zero, an agent selects a random action (i.e., exploration) with probability or the action minimizing Q-value (i.e., exploitation) with probability It is common to start with the value of close to 1 and gradually decrease it as information about the environment accumulates.\n\nIn a powerful deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework developed by Mnih et al. \\[[19](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0019),[20](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0020)\\], a parameterized deep Q-network (DQN) is introduced to approximate the Q-value. Each layer in the DQN outputs a [linear combination](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/linear-combination \"Learn more about linear combination from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of inputs and parameters. The framework introduces [activation functions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/activation-function \"Learn more about activation functions from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") between layers, such as rectified linear unit (ReLU), exponential linear unit (ELU), and scaled ELU (SELU), to describe the complex relationships beyond linearity. However, DQN tends to underestimate the Q-values in stochastic environments due to the ‘min’ operator in calculating the target value Double DQN (DDQN) [\\[27\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0027) performs the action selection and Q-value evaluation separately using two different DQNs (i.e., online and target networks), thereby avoiding the underestimation of the Q-values and stabilizing the learning process. The target value is rewritten as(7)where is the Q-value estimated using the online network with parameters and is the Q-value estimated using the target network with parameters respectively. The parameters are periodically updated to the parameters every steps.\n\nIn addition, one can introduce the experience replay [\\[45\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0045), in which agents store the experiences as tuples in a replay buffer and update the online network parameters based on a batch of uniformly sampled tuples from the replay buffer. The uniformly drawn samples significantly reduce the variance of updates owing to the weakened correlation, thereby suppressing the oscillation or divergence of the parameters during the training process. Combining these techniques, DDQN calculates the loss function and updates the online network parameters to minimize by the [gradient descent](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/gradient-descent \"Learn more about gradient descent from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") as follows:(8)(9)where represents a uniform distribution over the replay buffer and is a batch of the tuples sampled from\n\nAgents can gauge the importance of each experience by the temporal difference error (TD-error), i.e., the difference between the expected Q-values before and after the experience. In prioritized experience replay (PER) \\[[46](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0046)\\], the alternative sampling density of a batch of experience tuples which was uniformly distributed, is given as:(10)where is the TD-error; and is an importance sampling hyperparameter, with corresponding to the existing experience replay. The loss function in [Eq. (8)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0008) can be calculated more efficiently using importance sampling as follows:(11)where denotes the probability mass function of the discrete uniform distribution; and is the likelihood ratio to compensate for the bias caused by introducing the alternative sampling density The initial learning process is highly non-stationary because the online and target networks have not been trained enough. Therefore, even if the estimate is slightly biased, stabilization should be the top priority at the beginning phase of learning, and importance sampling correction may be considered later. To this end, in [Eq. (11)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0011) is replaced by , defined as(12)where is the number of experiences in the replay buffer and is a hyperparameter controlling how much to compensate for the bias. As is gradually annealed toward 1.0, starting from a low value (e.g., typically around 0.4 to 0.6), the bias is completely compensated. When combined, DDQN and PER exert a substantial [synergistic effect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/synergistic-effect \"Learn more about synergistic effect from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), thereby neutralizing a significant portion of the existing limitations of Q-learning algorithms.\n\n### 2.4. Factorization in multi-agent reinforcement learning\n\nIn addition to increasing the efficiency of DRL like DDQN with PER, dividing the original problem into multiple subproblems can be a more effective solution to overcome the curse of dimensionality caused by the exponentially increasing number of states and actions. A divide-and-conquer strategy called a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) deploys multiple agents in each segmented state and action spaces, and the agents learn policies to achieve the minimum costs independently or through cooperation.\n\nIf there are no cost functions that agents jointly contribute, a given environment can be simplified by decomposing it into several smaller independent environments \\[[30](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0030),[47](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0047)\\]. In other words, the optimal decision set in sub-problems yields the same solution as the optimal global decision-making. Then, the size of the action space is shrunk from to where is the number of agents, and is redefined as the number of available actions for the agent. As a result, one can handle environments with large spaces of states and actions based on the large scalability.\n\nHowever, in most of complex environments, cost functions take a combination of various states and actions as input, e.g., [Eq. (1)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0001). This leads to the multi-agent credit allocation problem [\\[33\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0033), in which the contributions of individual agents to the cost function must be accurately inferred. To this end, the problem can be segmented into multiple independent environments by factorizing the centralized cost into the sum of decentralized costs through [neural networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/neural-network \"Learn more about neural networks from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") called value decomposition networks (VDNs) [\\[32\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0032) or user-defined functions. No matter how sophisticated the original cost is segmented, accuracy loss is inevitable during the [factorization process](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/factorization-process \"Learn more about factorization process from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), thereby resulting in a trade-off between accuracy and scalability.\n\n## 3\\. Proposed algorithm: parallelized multi-agent deep Q-network (PM-DQN)\n\nThe MARL method combined with DDQN and PER improves the scalability with minimal loss of accuracy, allowing the MDP framework to be applied to complex environments. However, as the number of components in the system increases, the accuracy loss of the MARL method gradually accumulates, eventually leading to a failure in [optimal policy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/optimal-policy \"Learn more about optimal policy from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") search. To alleviate the scalability issue, in this section, we propose a novel MARL algorithm termed “Parallelized Multi-agent Deep Q-Network” (PM-DQN), which assigns multiple agents to subsystems based on community detection, and makes the agents explore decentralized cost-minimizing policies under various hyperparameter values in multiple processing units. The proposed algorithm consists of three steps differentiated from others as follows: (1) system simplification based on network clustering for effective agent allocation, (2) factorization of centralized costs based on a predefined function, and (3) the hyperparameter tuning with parallel processing. [Fig. 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0002)(a) and (b) respectively illustrate the proposed algorithm's microscopic and macroscopic structures of operations.\n\n![Fig 2](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S095183202300426X-gr2.jpg)\n\n1.

(a) Learning process using DDQN with PER in a processing unit, and (b) overall procedure of Parallelized Multi-agent Deep Q-Network (PM-DQN) algorithm.\n\n### 3.1. Step 1: identification of subsystems based on community detection\n\nIn optimizing MARL-based O&M strategies in large-scale systems, it is necessary to find an appropriate balance between minimizing accuracy loss and efficient reduction of the state and action spaces. To this end, we propose a decomposition of the system into a few subsystems, i.e., communities of components. By grouping deeply related components in terms of functionality or densely connected components into one subsystem, the existing system can be simplified into another system of subsystems. This can also lower computational complexity that may scale exponentially with the number of components, while minimizing loss of information. Various algorithms such as spectral [clustering algorithms](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/clustering-algorithm \"Learn more about clustering algorithms from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") \\[[38](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0038),[48](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0048)\\] and Markov clustering algorithm \\[[49](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0049),[50](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0050)\\] have been proposed for community detection. In this paper, the target system is represented by subsystems instead of the existing components based on the Girvan-Newman algorithm \\[[39](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0039),[51](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0051)\\].\n\nThe Girvan-Newman algorithm sequentially removes edges with the highest edge-betweenness, which means the probability that the shortest paths between all node pairs in the graph go through the edge [\\[52\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0052). As edges with high edge-betweenness are removed, the entire graph representing the system is divided into several isolated clusters, and the process of edge removal ends when all edges are removed. In Girvan-Newman algorithm, the modularity is introduced to stop the process at an appropriate time [\\[51\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0051). The modularity represents the difference between the actual number of intra-cluster edges in the existing graph and the expected number of intra-cluster edges when reconstructing the graph while preserving the degree of each node, and is defined as(13)where is the number of isolated clusters; is the number of edges in the graph; is the number of intra-cluster edges in cluster and is the sum of degrees of the nodes in cluster Modularity is updated whenever an edge is removed, and when it is maximized, one can identify subsystems that are separated from each other.\n\nOnce subsystems in the target system are identified using the Girvan-Newman algorithm, we can assign an agent to learn the O&M strategy of each subsystem. However, there is a problem in utilizing the community detection result for PM-DQN; since all agents must be trained for optimal decision-making for the system-level optimal policy, the convergence of PM-DQN is governed by the slowest learning rate among agents (generally the agent with the largest state and action spaces). If components are concentrated in specific clusters, the learning time of the agents increases exponentially, thereby leading to a decrease in learning efficiency of PM-DQN. Therefore, a procedure for adjusting the subsystems to an even size is necessary. To this end, after initial grouping based on the Girvan-Newman algorithm, some components in the largest subsystem are reallocated to other neighboring subsystems. In this process, the number of edges connecting subsystems should be minimized to prevent loss of calculation accuracy due to system simplification.\n\n[Fig. 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0003) shows a simplified California gas distribution system (modified from [\\[53\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0053)) with 48 gas [substations](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/substations \"Learn more about substations from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of two types and 60 bidirectional pipelines. It is assumed that the pipelines are intact during the lifetime of the system, and only the deterioration of the gas substations, whose states can be periodically identified, is considered. The system can be described by a graph model with 48 nodes and 60 edges. [Table 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#tbl0002) shows how modularity and the number of detected clusters change with edge removal by the Girvan-Newman algorithm. As the edges are removed continuously, the number of clusters increases, but the modularity peaks at 8 clusters. However, the detected clusters consist of five to seven components as shown in [Fig. 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0004)(a), resulting in differences in the action space of the agents. Since the learning rate of the agent managing the largest subsystem is lower than that of the other agents, the benefits of parallel processing in simultaneous training of all agents can be underutilized. To compensate for this limitation, one component is reallocated from the largest subsystem to the neighboring smallest subsystem 3 as shown in [Fig. 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0004)(b), making the number of components within subsystems as uniform as possible. In contrast to the previous subsystems in [Fig. 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0004)(a), all subsystems in [Fig. 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0004)(b) consist of the same number of components, so the learning rate of the agent is expected to be similar. The needs for this procedure are discussed through numerical examples in [Section 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0014) by comparing the learning efficiency with or without the reallocation.\n\n![Fig 3](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S095183202300426X-gr3.jpg)\n\n1.

(a) Subsystems detected by Girvan-Newman algorithm, and (b) subsystems with uniformly reallocated components.\n\n### 3.2. Step 2: factorization of centralized costs\n\nAfter assigning one agent to each subsystem detected in Step 1, multiple agents make O&M decisions by comprehensively considering the state of components within each subsystem. To carry out the decision making independently but efficiently for all subsystems, the total cost should be factorized into individual subsystems based on effective multi-agent credit allocation. For example, the total cost in [Eq. (1)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0001) is divided into two parts: decentralized costs (e.g., and and centralized costs (e.g., Since decentralized costs obviously arise from each component, it makes sense to impose the sum of decentralized costs of the components in a subsystem to the corresponding agent. However, allocating the centralized cost to individual agents requires the introduction of VDN or predefined functions. To this end, PM-DQN finds the subsystems that are presumed to cause the loss of system, and selectively allocates centralized costs to those subsystems based on a predefined function. More specifically, by splitting the centralized cost and summing up the decentralized costs, the total decentralized cost for subsystem is expressed as(14)where is redefined as the action chosen by agent at time is the factorized cost transferred from the centralized cost to subsystem and is the hyperparameter that determines the weight of the factorized cost. The factorized cost is predefined as follows:(15)where is the QoS loss in the subsystem; and is a subset of which is the state vector of components belonging to the subsystem. While is calculated based on the maximum flow capacity between two predetermined terminals, is defined as the difference between the total inflow and outflow of the subsystem. The structure of [Eq. (15)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0015) is similar to that of [Eq. (2)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0002) before factorization, but individual agents infer the causality between QoS losses of system and their subsystems using the min operator.\n\nUsing [Eqs. (6)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0006), [(7)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0007), [(14)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0014), and [(15)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0015), one can calculate individual Q-values for each agent In this paper, we utilize the DDQN combined with PER (introduced in [Section 2.3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0008)) for more efficient and stable Q-learning. More specifically, the online network with parameters and the target network with parameters for take the system state vector and the current time step as inputs, and respectively output the Q-values and according to each action in the form of vectors. Then, the optimal action based on the estimated is converted into an \\-dimensional one-hot encoding vector, which is multiplied with the vector form of to update the online Q-value. Unlike these online parameters that are updated every step, the target network parameters are periodically updated to the online parameters every steps. It should be noted that, unlike VDN, the expected total life-cycle cost of the system is not equal to the sum of those caused by the factorized costs [\\[37\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0037). As all agents choose the actions that minimize their respective the system-level action set is redefined as(16)\n\nIn the learning process of DDQN, the performance of the PM-DQN depends significantly on the hyperparameter in [Eq. (14)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0014). Therefore, the hyperparameter value should be appropriately determined depending on the environment (e.g., system topologies, O&M costs, discount factor In addition, there is no way to find the optimal value analytically, while heuristics require substantial computational costs for\n\n### 3.3. Step 3: parallel processing-based hyperparameter tuning\n\nFor effective hyperparameter tuning, we introduce parallel processing in the proposed algorithm. Processing units (e.g., CPUs or GPUs) are classified into five groups with different hyperparameter values. In each unit, agents explore the optimal decentralized policies using the \\-greedy algorithm simultaneously under each given hyperparameter as illustrated in [Fig. 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0002)(a). After training agents for a sufficiently large number of epochs, called a cycle, one can judge the superiority of policies based on hyperparameter values through the expected total life-cycle costs Prior to the next cycle, the parameters of the online and target networks in all processing units, and for are synchronized with those showing the best performance in the previous cycle, as shown in [Fig. 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0002)(b), thereby contributing to improving the master policy. Through the synchronization process, some rarely explored near-optimal policies can be propagated to other processing units, resulting in significant performance gains. Then, hyperparameter is tuned as follows:(17)where is an exponentially decaying step size; and In addition, when the expected life-cycle cost has sufficiently converged through comparison of results of the parallel processing, the algorithm is terminated early. [Algorithm 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#tbl0010) provides a pseudo-code of the proposed PM-DQN algorithm.\n\nAlgorithm 1.

Numerical examples\n\nTo demonstrate the proposed PM-DQN, we consider two numerical examples inspired by Andriotis & Papakonstantinou [\\[10\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0010) and Stern et al.

The life-cycle span of each system TLS is set to 50 steps (i.e., 50 years) with a discount factor of γ\\=0.95. The coefficient fSD in [Eqs. (2)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0002) and [(15)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0015) for the system damage cost cSD is set to 5.0 in both examples.\n\nTo build and implement our own custom environments, we use OpenAI Gym [\\[54\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0054), a toolkit for reinforcement learning research. All experiments are performed using the Keras [deep learning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/deep-learning \"Learn more about deep learning from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") Python library [\\[55\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0055) with Tensorflow backend [\\[56\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0056) on a server with 2 Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU Gold 6240R CPUs at 2.40 GHz and 256GB [RAM](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/reliability-availability-and-maintainability-reliability-engineering \"Learn more about RAM from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). The online and target networks consist of three fully connected hidden layers, each with SELU [activation functions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/activation-function \"Learn more about activation functions from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") per example. For stochastic [gradient descent](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/gradient-descent \"Learn more about gradient descent from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") on the network parameter space, we use the Nesterov-accelerated Adaptive Moment Estimation (Nadam) optimizer [\\[57\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0057), combining the Adaptive Movement Estimation (Adam) with Nesterov momentum [\\[58\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0058). DDQNs explore and exploit complex environments using the ε\\-greedy algorithm mentioned in [Section 2.3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0008), where the exploration probability ε decreases from 0.5 to 0 for every cycle along with the [cosine function](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/cosine-function \"Learn more about cosine function from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") [\\[59\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0059). For model training based on parallel processing on multiple processors, the multiprocessing library [\\[60\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0060) is implemented. [Appendix B](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0020) provides more detailed information about hyperparameters for PM-DQN.\n\nSince it is intractable to obtain the [optimal policy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/optimal-policy \"Learn more about optimal policy from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") for these examples due to the curse of dimensionality, two conventional O&M schemes and two MARL methods are also implemented as baseline policies as follows to confirm the superior performance of the PM-DQN:\n\n-   •\n    \n    Condition-based maintenance (CBM): agents repair components that have deteriorated below optimized threshold states. Since the number of all combinable threshold cases is exponentially proportional to the number of components n, it is extremely time-consuming to evaluate the system life-time cost for all policies. In numerical examples, the optimal threshold state set is explored through iterations that sequentially update the optimal threshold state of each component that minimizes the system life-cycle cost. The number of threshold combinations per iteration scales linearly with the number of components.\n    \n-   •\n    \n    Time-based maintenance (TBM): agents periodically repair individual components, regardless of their state, at certain time intervals optimized for each component. To find the optimal repair intervals, we use iterations in the same form as CBM's policy exploration.\n    \n-   •\n    \n    Subsystem-level optimal maintenance (SOM): agents assigned to subsystems independently learn policies to minimize the cost of each subsystem in [Eq. (14)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0014), where the factorized centralized cost cf,j(St) depends only on the QoS loss in the jth subsystem, cf,jSOM(Stj)\\=fSD·Lj(Stj), instead of [Eq. (15)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#eqn0015). Other than the factorized cost, the identified subsystems to which agents are assigned and the hyperparameters in [Appendix B](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0020) are shared with PM-DQN.\n    \n-   •\n    \n    Deep Centralized Multi-agent Actor Critic (DCMAC) [\\[10\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0010): agents learn policies based on two separate [neural networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/neural-network \"Learn more about neural networks from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), called actor-critic methods, each approximating a centralized policy function and the expected total life-cycle costs. Actions on individual components are learned conditionally independent of each other. The details of structures and hyperparameters tuned for DCMAC in each numerical examples are given in [Appendix B](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0020). In Example 2, to shorten the training time and streamline the process of efficiently exploring learning rates for actor and critic networks, parallelized DCMAC is introduced with periodic synchronization and compared to single-processing DCMAC.\n    \n\n### 4.1. Example 1: multi-state general system with 15 components\n\nA 15-component system is represented as a _general_ system, i.e., not series- or parallel-system, in [Fig. 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0005). All components are assumed to be Type I. The system QoS is defined as the maximum flow capacity MFsys between both left and right sides, which is 2.0 when all components operate in the AGAN state. As indicated by the hatched blocks in [Fig. 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0005), three subsystems of five components are detected based on the Girvan-Newman algorithm. By grouping components, the size of the action space is shrunk from 215\\=32,768 to 3×25\\=96, since the three agents only share information about the system state St and select actions atj for j∈\\[1,3\\] independently.\n\n![Fig 5](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S095183202300426X-gr5.jpg)\n\n1.

A general system with 15 multi-state components, simplified by three subsystems.\n\nBefore comparing the results of the proposed algorithm with those of the four baseline policies, we discuss the appropriateness of periodic synchronization in the PM-DQN. [Table 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#tbl0003) shows the average life-cycle costs and 95% confidence intervals of the realization of the policies trained on parallel units with and without periodic synchronization in the PM-DQN. The mean converges rapidly to the optimal life-cycle cost when accompanied by periodic synchronization. The standard deviation also decreases significantly, and the [coefficient of variation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/coefficient-of-variation \"Learn more about coefficient of variation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") (c.o.v.) is less than 1% after the fourth cycle (i.e., 4,000 epochs), at which hyperparameter ω is tuned around the optimal value of 4.75. Since the step size λ\\=0.25 is already small enough, the expected life-cycle cost of the policy explored at this time does not have a large difference from the optimal life-cycle cost after the 10th cycle. That is, when the step size and c.o.v. are sufficiently small (e.g., less than 0.5 and 1%, respectively), the algorithm can be terminated early without significant loss in terms of performance compared to when it progressed to the end. On the other hand, with single-cycle learning, although learning through the same number of epochs, the life-cycle cost estimates have a significant variance, and the mean cost is also higher than that of periodic synchronization. This inferior performance arises because there is no chance to tune the hyperparameter ω and explore good policies in many ways. Some outliers inevitably occur during parallel processing, but there are no other means for correcting them. Conversely, even if one or two learners find a rare near-optimal policy, these policies are not propagated to most computational resources and are not further developed.\n\nTable 3. Expected life-cycle costs and 95% confidence intervals of realization of the trained policies with and without periodic synchronization in PM-DQN.\n\n| Number of Epochs | w/ Periodic Sync | w/o Periodic Sync |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1,000 | 46.04±35.99 |  |\n| 2,000 | 33.65±3.44 |  |\n| 4,000 | 29.05±0.48 |  |\n| 6,000 | 28.71±0.53 |  |\n| 10,000 | 28.33±0.54 | 40.99±20.20 |\n\nIn this example, 5×15\\=75 and 50×15\\=750 combinations of threshold state and time interval sets are explored to optimize CBM and TBM, respectively, through five iterations. As a result, the optimal threshold state set for CBM and the repair interval set for TBM are determined, as shown in [Appendix C](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0021). In contrast, since MARL methods including SOM, PM-DQN, and DCMAC take the state combination of the components in a subsystem or a system or centralized costs as input, it is difficult to specify the damage state at which agents repair individual components. The performances of baselines and the proposed policy are estimated through 1,000 demonstrations in terms of the total life-cycle costs ctot, and the results are summarized in [Table 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#tbl0004) with the time required for iterative operation or model training. The TBM policy was evaluated as the most ineffective one due to the stochastic environment. Although the SOM shares the subsystems and hyperparameters for model learning with PM-DQN, each agent learns the subsystem-level optimal policy, resulting in higher life-cycle costs than PM-DQN at the system level. On the other hand, the optimal policy learned by the PM-DQN shows the lowest estimated life-cycle cost, which is almost identical to those of the optimal policies proposed by CBM and DCMAC. Comparing the computational time among them, the advantage of PM-DQN in computational efficiency becomes clear. CBM takes 3.5 times longer than the computational time of PM-DQN, even though search of all combinations is replaced with iterations. Although DCMAC requires about 47.5x more learning time than PM-DQN due to the difference in the number of processors, it can be shortened through parallelization and the improved convergence speed is compared on the complex system in Example 2.\n\nTable 4. Life-cycle costs and computational time of PM-DQN and four baselines for Example 1.\n\n| Method | Total life-cycle cost | Time (_sec_) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| CBM | 28.42 | 9,323 |\n| TBM | 56.71 | 99,174 |\n| SOM | 35.41 | 2,523 |\n| DCMAC (single processing) | 28.57 | 125,773 |\n| **PM-DQN** | **28.33** | **2,647** |\n\n[Fig. 6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0006)(a) and (b) show the realization of the O&M process for the individual subsystems according to the optimal policies based on SOM and PM-DQN, respectively. In these figures showing time histories of component-level costs in each subsystem, blue bars indicate maintenance costs cM,i spent on repairs, while red bars, representing shutdown costs cS,i, are not marked on the chart because all components are repaired before shutdown. Under the SOM policy, each agent immediately takes the O&M policy to minimize the loss of QoS in individual subsystems, thereby repairing subsystems immediately even minor damage at the subsystem level as if they were part of a series system as shown in [Fig. 6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0006)(a). In the PM-DQN policy, the agent managing subsystem 3 operates in the same way as in the SOM policy, because subsystem 3 significantly influences the system QoS. In contrast, the other two subsystems connected in parallel are treated even more tolerantly than the SOM, since the two act as a detour to each other and the failure of either subsystem does not directly lead to the loss of system QoS. This difference between these two algorithms is clearly shown in [Fig. 7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0007), which illustrates the annual average flow capacity loss in individual subsystems and the system under all policies. As can be seen from the results of all policies, the QoS loss in subsystem 3 plays a dominant role in the QoS loss of the system due to its series-connected topology in the system.\n\n![Fig 6](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S095183202300426X-gr6.jpg)\n\n1.

Annual average loss of QoS in individual subsystems or system in Example 1 under each policy.\n\n### 4.2. Example 2: the simplified California gas distribution system with 48 gas substations\n\nExample 2 deals with a more realistic lifeline system, the California gas distribution system in [Fig. 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0003). Unlike Example 1, there are two types of components in the system; some components located in the west, close to the Pacific Ocean, are modeled as type II components with a high deterioration rate, while the rest are modeled as Type I. The maximum flow capacity MFsys between two [terminal nodes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/terminal-node \"Learn more about terminal nodes from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") is given as 1.0 when all [substations](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/substations \"Learn more about substations from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") operate in the AGAN state. Through community detection shown in [Fig. 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0004)(a), the size of the action space is shrunk from 248≅2.81×1014 to 25+6×26+27\\=544. After resizing the subsystems as shown in [Fig. 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0004)(b), the largest action space is reduced from 27\\=128 to 26\\=64.\n\nBefore comparing the performance of the proposed algorithm with the baselines, we examine the needs for component reallocation discussed in [Section 3.1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0011). Boxplots in [Fig. 8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0008) show the expected life-cycle costs before and after reallocating the subsystem sizes evenly for learning cycles of PM-DQN. Outliers under the worst performing hyperparameters are excluded for visualization purposes. Comparing the training results up to the third cycle, in which sufficient learning has not been achieved yet, the variance of the learning rate of PM-DQN without reallocation is significantly larger than that with reallocation. This is because the policy search for a relatively large number of state and action spaces has not been conducted effectively and sufficiently in the largest subsystem 2. While their variances become similar after the 4th cycle, the former's estimated life-cycle cost becomes equal to that of the latter only after the 10th cycle is completed. As learning continues, both expected costs keep decreasing, achieving almost the same life-cycle cost. This shows that PM-DQN works well for large systems with components that have different [degradation processes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/degradation-process \"Learn more about degradation processes from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), although the convergence rate becomes lower than before.\n\n![Fig 8](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S095183202300426X-gr8.jpg)\n\n1.

Expected life-cycle costs for learning cycles with and without reallocation in PM-DQN.\n\nThe performances of baselines and MARL-based policies including the PM-DQN without reallocation estimated through 1,000 demonstrations are summarized in [Table 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#tbl0005). The optimal CBM and TBM policies are explored through five iterations as in Example 1. As a result, the threshold state set and repair time interval set are respectively determined, as shown [Appendix C](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#sec0021). As in Example 1, the TBM policy shows inferior results due to the stochastic environment, and the life-cycle cost of the CBM policy, showing excellent performance in Example 1, is higher than those of other MARL-based algorithms. While CBM evaluates the effect of individual components on system QoS at the component level and determines the state thresholds for repair, the system QoS fundamentally depends on the combination of states of various components. This characteristic becomes more prominent as systems get more complex, which is confirmed through the performance change of CBM compared to MARL-based approaches in Example 1 and Example 2. Although the CBM policy ranks with the DCMAC and PM-DQN policies in a simple system in Example 1, it faces the limitations in Example 2.\n\nTable 5. Life-cycle costs and computational time of PM-DQN and four baselines for Example 2.\n\n| Method | Total life-cycle cost | Time (_sec_) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| CBM | 89.95 | 20,126 |\n| TBM | 161.61 | 214,140 |\n| SOM | 88.82 | 103,456 |\n| DCMAC (parallel processing) | 87.13 | 137,211 |\n| PM-DQN (w/o Reallocation) | 86.77 | 97,437 |\n| **PM-DQN (w/ Reallocation)** | **86.60** | **101,934** |\n\nThis also applies to SOM. Although the SOM policy may be an optimal decision at each subsystem level, the result of the optimal PM-DQN policy in [Table 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#tbl0005) shows that the subsystem-level optimal policy does not match that at the system level, where the hyperparameter ω is eventually tuned to 23.90. [Fig. 9](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0009) shows a simplified California gas system consisting of 9 subsystems, and the realizations of the system O&M by SOM and PM-DQN policies are shown in [Fig. 10](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0010)(a) and (b), respectively. To minimize the QoS loss at the subsystem level, SOM manages subsystems 3 and 4 conservatively compared to PM-DQN even though they are connected in parallel. Accordingly, the loss of QoS in individual subsystems is well maintained at a low level in the SOM policy as shown in [Fig. 10](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0010)(a). However, because large maintenance cost is required for the SOM policy, the life-cycle cost under the policy shows inferior results to the PM-DQN and DCMAC policies.\n\n![Fig 9](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S095183202300426X-gr9.jpg)\n\n1.

Life-cycle O&M results during an epoch in Example 2: component-level costs (i.e., cM,i and cS,i) and loss of QoS in each subsystem (i.e., cf,jSOM\\=fSD·Lj) under (a) the SOM policy, and (b) the PM-DQN policy.\n\nIn contrast, the PM-DQN policy considers the QoS loss of subsystems and systems simultaneously. Subsystems except for subsystems 3 and 4 have no separate bypass. This means that, even if agents maintain subsystems 3 and 4 loosely, other subsystems should be managed conservatively as shown in [Fig. 10](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0010)(b). In this way, system simplification based on community detection identifies the system topology and provides the basis for convergence of each agent's local optimal policy to the global optimal policy. The PM-DQN policy takes advantage of this to manage the system, thereby showing the best expected life-cycle costs at the system level.\n\n[Fig. 11](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#fig0011) shows the training history of DCMAC with and without parallel processing. In parallel processing, the optimal learning rates for actor and critical networks are explored in the range of \\[10−7,10−3\\] and \\[10−5,10−3\\] respectively, gradually converging to the combination of learning rates with the lowest life-cycle costs. The best learning rates among the explored ones are utilized for single-processing DCMAC as well as the parallelized DCMAC. For the first cycle (i.e., the first 5,000 episodes), there is not much difference between the two results. However, the gap widens considerably right after the synchronization of parallel-trained policies. The difference never diminishes until the end of training, and the superior performance resulting from parallelization is comparable to PM-DQN; comparing them in terms of performance and computation time, PM-DQN is slightly better, but the difference is not significant considering the structural difference between the two models. This implies that the proposed parallel processing framework with periodic synchronization has a dominant effect on performance improvement and it can be transferred to other DRL methods.\n\n![Fig 11](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S095183202300426X-gr11.jpg)\n\n1.

Summary and conclusions\n\nThis paper proposed an optimal decision-making framework based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), termed parallelized multi-agent deep Q-network (PM-DQN), for efficient risk-informed operation and management (O&M) scheduling of large civil lifeline systems. Existing methods dealt with these system-level O&M scheduling problems by limiting the size of the systems or approximating them as component-level [subproblems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/subproblem \"Learn more about subproblems from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") due to the exponentially growing state and action spaces. However, these types of computational complexity reduction may incur a significant loss of accuracy. Moreover, even if the action space is relaxed, it is still necessary to find the best policy by exploring all policy combinations. To find the optimal policy, the multi-agent credit allocation problem should be solved by inferring the contributions to the centralized cost function. Unstable feedback depending on the policy selection of other agents hinders decentralized policy learning. In contrast, the proposed algorithm overcame this challenge by introducing a divide-and-conquer strategy with community detection and parallel processing. Since network clustering is based on the system topology, the subsystems identified by the Girvan-Newman [clustering algorithm](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/clustering-algorithm \"Learn more about clustering algorithm from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") can achieve an appropriate balance between accuracy loss and computational complexity reduction. The strength of the proposed algorithm is further enhanced by reducing the policy exploration time and tuning the optimal hyperparameters in combination with parallel operation. Multiple processing units derive an optimal policy set under hyperparameter tuning and periodic synchronization with the best one. The accuracy and efficiency of PM-DQN were demonstrated on a multi-state general system with 15 components and the California gas distribution system with 48 components. In each numerical example, the optimal PM-DQN policies outperformed baseline alternatives including conventional O&M policies and other MARL-based policies in terms of computational time as well as the expected life-cycle costs. In particular, the California gas distribution system represented as a general system of subsystems through community detection shows the system's topological characteristics prominently, indicating the reason for the good performance of PM-DQN in subsystem level decision-making.\n\nThe proposed PM-DQN trains multiple agents simultaneously by defining factorization cost functions based on the causal relationship between the flow capacity losses in the whole system and subsystems. Because the hyperparameter tuning and the entire process of policy exploration are performed independently across multiple processing units, the proposed algorithm has high scalability for the ever-evolving scale of processing units. In addition, the algorithm features flexible handling of the problem, such as adjusting the number of processing units according to the complexity of problems and the computing power. The parallelization remains scalable and flexible even when other MARL algorithms are used. However, there are some other obstacles arising from the limitations of MDPs that hinder the modeling and application of real lifeline network system O&M; it is difficult to consider the time required for actions in the discrete-time domain, and there is a time gap between state change and maintenance actions. In addition, if more diverse action options, such as minor repairs or reinforcements, are given, policy learning at the subsystem level may suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Nevertheless, for efficient MARL and parallel processing, the proposed framework of deploying agents and periodically synchronizing multiple processors can be applied to various other DRL methods. As shown in Example 2, vanilla DRLs specialized for parallel processing are expected to improve exploration and training stability, thereby enabling simple but powerful end-to-end learning without additional clustering or cost splitting.\n\nFurthermore, we can extend the proposed method to a [partially observable MDP](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/partially-observable-markov-decision-process \"Learn more about partially observable MDP from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") (POMDP) environment by considering monitoring errors in grasping system states. The computational cost is higher than that in MDP environment because belief function is continuously updated, and monitoring action is additionally considered. However, we can broaden the scalability of the existing algorithms by taking advantage of parallel processing and system simplification based on network clustering. Further research is underway to model state changes in the continuous-time domain and actions that take different times using Semi-Markov decision processes [\\[23\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202300426X#bib0023). In addition, the development of such a framework is expected to achieve the scalability to cope with unexpected events (e.g., earthquakes, typhoons).\n\n## CRediT authorship contribution statement\n\n**Dongkyu Lee:** Visualization, Validation, Software, Methodology, Conceptualization, Investigation, Writing – original draft. **Junho Song:** Resources, Project administration, Funding acquisition, Conceptualization, Supervision, Writing – review & editing.\n---\ncreated: 2023-09-21T15:53:57 (UTC +01:00)\ntags: []\nsource: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347\nauthor: Rongqi Chen\n---\n\n# Intelligent safe operation and maintenance of oil and gas production systems: Connotations and key technologies - ScienceDirect\n\n> ## Excerpt\n> Oil and gas production systems have the characteristics of high operation and maintenance risk and great accident influence. With the deep integration…\n\n---\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nAs a typical high-risk industry, oil and gas production is characterized by a wide variety of equipment and facilities, complex processes, and harsh working environments \\[[1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#bib1)\\]. Although the overall safe production situation is controllable, inherent risks persist for a long time, and risk prevention capabilities in professional fields need to be continually strengthened. In recent years, the “short board effect” and “cask effect” of risk management in the process of oil and gas production have become increasingly prominent, mainly because the risk of blowout has not been thoroughly removed, refining equipment and tanks occasionally explode, and accidents involving fatalities in high-risk operations frequently occur \\[[2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#bib2)\\]. Consequently, it is necessary to improve the digitization, networking, and intelligence levels of the [operation and maintenance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/operation-and-maintenance \"Learn more about operation and maintenance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of oil and gas production systems to reduce risks, improve the safety of operation sites, and promote the digital transformation of the [oil and gas industry](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/petroleum-industry \"Learn more about oil and gas industry from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") \\[[3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#bib3)\\].\n\nAs the core of digital transformation \\[[4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#bib4)\\], operation and maintenance have gradually developed from the original mechanized post-operation mode driven by steam technology to the automatic regular mode driven by [power technology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/power-engineering \"Learn more about power technology from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). Currently, with the emergence of information technology, combined with the promotion of information technology and visual operation and maintenance by computer and network technology, the real-time monitoring and online evaluation of equipment operation can be achieved, enabling the timely detection and maintenance of anomalies \\[[5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#bib5)\\]. The world is currently experiencing the fourth industrial revolution. The new generation of digital technology promotes comprehensive integration with industry, bringing about fundamental changes in production and management methods. Using information technologies such as big data, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and digital twin, combined with [physical modeling](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/physical-modeling \"Learn more about physical modeling from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and mechanism analysis to evaluate equipment operation status, intelligent operation and maintenance enables the identification of fault modes, estimations of their severity, and predictions of remaining life. This effectively optimizes operation and maintenance decisions and allows maintenance activities to be organized in a reasonable manner \\[[6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#bib6)\\].\n\nOil and gas production systems are characterized by high operation and maintenance risks, and high susceptibility to accidents. Conventional operation and maintenance methods cannot effectively perceive and handle abnormal events in a timely manner \\[[7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#bib7)\\]. In recent years, domestic and foreign oil and gas enterprises have made significant progress in areas such as drilling safety, gathering and transportation safety \\[[8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#bib8)\\], and remote operation and maintenance \\[[9](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#bib9)\\]. The accelerated transformation of safe production from static analysis to dynamic perception, from post-emergency response to prevention, and from single-point prevention and control to [joint](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/joints-structural-components \"Learn more about joint from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") prevention has enhanced the safety of oil and gas production systems and achieved high-quality developments in the oil and gas industry \\[[10](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#bib10)\\]. However, there is still room for improvement in key technologies underlying the intelligent and safe operation and maintenance of oil and gas production systems. Thus, it is necessary to develop an innovative safe production technology system with desirable information, digitization, and intelligence through the integration of emerging technologies, to enhance the perception, monitoring, early warning, disposal, and evaluation capabilities of the oil and gas industry \\[[11](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#bib11)\\]. The shift from conventional techniques to intelligent and safe operation and maintenance makes it possible to cultivate and promote new models of intelligent operation and maintenance services, thereby ensuring the safe and reliable operation of production equipment \\[[12](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#bib12)\\]. In view of the current urgent demands for the digital transformation of oil and gas production, operation, and maintenance, this paper summarizes advanced technologies such as big data, digital twin, machine learning, and edge computing, define the connotation and key elements of intelligent safe operation and maintenance technology, analyze the existing problems and challenges, and construct an intelligent safe operation and maintenance technology system for the oil and gas industry. Research results provide technical support for fault-free oil and gas production, and promote the digital transformation of the conventional energy industry and the implementation of intelligent safe operation and maintenance technologies. In addition, the research results contribute to the safety of oil and gas production fields and promote the safe and healthy development of the oil and gas industry.\n\n## 2\\. Connotation of intelligent safe operation and maintenance technology for oil and gas production\n\n### 2.1. Definition of intelligent safe operation and maintenance for oil and gas production\n\nIntelligent [operation and maintenance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/operation-and-maintenance \"Learn more about operation and maintenance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") refers to the use of new-generation [information and communication technologies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/information-and-communication-technologies \"Learn more about information and communication technologies from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") (e.g., cloud computing, big data, the internet-of-things, and artificial intelligence) to achieve dynamic self-decision-making in oil and gas production systems. Intelligent and safe operation and maintenance in oil and gas production systems cover the entire process of oil and gas drilling, transportation, storage, refining, and [chemical engineering](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/chemical-engineering \"Learn more about chemical engineering from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), including health management, risk assessment, visual management, intelligent warning, risk prediction, and other operation and maintenance operations \\[[13](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#bib13),[14](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#bib14)\\], as shown in [Fig. 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#fig1). First, it is necessary to use edge-perception technology to acquire on-site production data, and then realize information modeling, data governance, and multi-source heterogeneous data integration based on big data technology. The aim is to fully utilize the value of data through functional algorithms and intelligent application models, enabling analysis of the intrinsic nature of monitoring data. Finally, combined with operation and maintenance service modules, this will achieve the operation and maintenance of the entire process, elements, and lifecycle of the oil and gas production system. Considering data management as the key, algorithms as the foundation, and operation and maintenance service as the platform, the deep integration of digital technology and traditional oil and gas production technology then makes it possible to continuously improve the level of digitization, networking, and intelligence of oil and gas production systems, and realize a digital transformation from conventional operation and maintenance to intelligent safe operation and maintenance.\n\n![Fig. 1](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2352854023000347-gr1.jpg)\n\n1.

Framework of intelligent safe operation and maintenance technology for oil and gas production.\n\n### 2.2. Key elements of intelligent safe operation and maintenance of oil and gas production\n\nOil and gas production systems have inherent risks. Existing risk prevention capabilities in different professional fields and key links still need to be strengthened \\[[15](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#bib15)\\]. Thus, intelligent safe operation and maintenance should start from three key elements: equipment safety, job safety, and process safety. By promoting the integration and innovation of oil and gas production with intelligent technology, potential dangers are fundamentally eliminated and the essential safety level of key core links in oil and gas production is improved, ultimately leading to safer development of oil and gas production systems.\n\nThe normal and stable operation of production equipment and facilities is the key to oil and gas systems \\[[16](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#bib16)\\]. Intelligent safe operation and maintenance provide technical support for on-site monitoring, fault warning, fault diagnosis, status evaluation, and other functions of critical equipment. There are various operations in the oil and gas production process, and the on-site situation is complex. Typically, there are multiple risk interference effects between operations, and the [operational risks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/operational-risk \"Learn more about operational risks from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") change dynamically \\[[17](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#bib17)\\]. Therefore, it is necessary to implement intelligent safe operation and maintenance systems in all key risk management and emergency response measures, as this will minimize the probability of accidents during the operation process. Oil and gas production covers the entire industrial chain from drilling and extraction to transportation, storage, refining, finished product processing, sales, and other upstream, midstream, and downstream industries, as shown in [Fig. 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#fig2). Therefore, it is necessary to establish a full factor oil and gas production safety framework. There are six factors that affect the stable operation of oil and gas production systems: (1) human, (2) equipment, (3) material, (4) technology, (5) environment, and (6) management. By considering these factors comprehensively, intelligent safe operation and maintenance can achieve safe production, improved quality and efficiency, and reduced costs. Based on monitoring data relating to the status of oil and gas production equipment and facilities, an intelligent safe operation and maintenance system can acquire performance indicators, speculate on key nodes of equipment failure, predict potential failure links, and ultimately ensure the safety of oil and gas production equipment. By collecting and sorting data, the intelligent safe operation and maintenance system can identify hazards, determine the degree of risk, and provide specific risk-mitigation measures to ensure the safety of oil and gas production. By constructing a production process model, an adaptive warning analysis method can be established to simulate actual working conditions and achieve risk prediction, thereby ensuring the safety of the oil and gas production process.\n\n![Fig. 2](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2352854023000347-gr2.jpg)\n\n1.

Framework for full-factor oil and gas production safety.\n\n### 2.3. Problems and challenges in intelligent safe operation and maintenance of oil and gas production\n\nTo date, there has been considerable research on the intelligent and safe operation and maintenance of oil and gas production. However, many problems and challenges remain in the acquisition and analysis of multi-source data relating to oil and gas field production safety, multi-dimensional and multi-scale risk evolution in oil and gas fields, and collaborative optimization and implementation on the industrial internet. This paper outlines three major challenges and four key issues that urgently need to be addressed in intelligent safe operation and maintenance.\n\nThe three major challenges are as follows: ① Difficulty of technical research. Typically, the traditional operation mode suffers from the fragmentation of data, prevalence of information silos, long development cycles, and inability to respond flexibly and quickly to new demands. This makes it difficult to satisfy the future demands for production and digital transformation. ② Weak ubiquitous perception. With numerous links and diverse risk factors, oil and gas production systems are very complicated. In certain specific business scenarios, intelligent exploration can be achieved, but few perception technologies can be applied. A system's ubiquitous perception ability needs to be further enhanced. ③ Difficulty of platform unification. The development and application of intelligent algorithms based on specific business scenarios are complicated by inconsistent data standards and isolated application systems \\[[18](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#bib18)\\]. Under such circumstances, it is difficult to construct a unified platform for data collection, transmission, application, centralized storage, and sharing.\n\nAt present, there are four key issues in intelligent security operation and maintenance.\n\n-   **1)**\n    \n    Evolution mechanism and risk characterization of multidimensional and multi-scale risks in the [oil and gas industry](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/petroleum-industry \"Learn more about oil and gas industry from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\").\n    \n\nThe failure or abnormality of a single item of production equipment may lead to the failure of other equipment, causing the fault to propagate. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the forms and rules of risk propagation across space \\[[19](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#bib19)\\]. By studying the risk propagation mechanism, it is possible to clarify the [directionality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/directionality \"Learn more about directionality from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and dependency relationships within the system, evaluate the risk evolution status, and construct a risk evolution model. This clarifies the causes and evolution processes of risks, and elucidates the risk propagation mechanism across devices, space, and time, ultimately revealing the risk evolution mechanism.\n\n-   **2)**\n    \n    **Multi-source heterogeneous big data integration and analysis in oil and gas field production safe operation and maintenance system.**\n    \n\nEfficient data mining, analysis, and processing are prerequisites for comprehensive analysis of system operation conditions, which includes not only the safety of physical equipment, but also the overall changes caused by data anomalies. Therefore, the first step is to determine the specific characteristics of multi-source heterogeneous data and establish key data acquisition methods from two dimensions: logical reasoning and data mining. Using multi-modal [deep learning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/deep-learning \"Learn more about deep learning from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), the integration of multi-source heterogeneous data can be achieved. This overcomes the integration difficulties caused by data heterogeneity \\[[20](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#bib20)\\] and [sparsity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/sparsity \"Learn more about sparsity from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), highlights the complex fusion and analysis of heterogeneous data, and clarifies the mechanism of multi-source heterogeneous big data integration analysis.\n\n-   **3)**\n    \n    **Edge-cloud collaborative safe operation and maintenance knowledge generation on industrial internet.**\n    \n\nEdge-cloud collaboration technology can promote the development of intelligent operation and maintenance levels in production systems \\[[21](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#bib21)\\]. Establishing a unified, centralized, and elastic cloud base enables the centralized deployment, integration, and sharing of applications in production systems, and a standardized cloud operation and maintenance environment. Based on edge-cloud [collaborative computing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/computer-supported-cooperative-work \"Learn more about collaborative computing from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") technology, operation and maintenance knowledge production mechanisms can be supported in different scenarios. Deploying a unified, open, and standardized oil and gas data platform permits the establishment of a universal, open, and scalable intelligent and safe operation and maintenance platform. Based on perception, interconnection, and data fusion, it then becomes possible to establish an operation and maintenance knowledge generation mechanism for key processes, such as real-time monitoring, intelligent diagnosis, automatic disposal, and intelligent optimization of production.\n\n-   **4)**\n    \n    **Digital-twin inference and decision-making for operating and data integration of oil and gas production equipment.**\n    \n\nAt present, reasoning decisions based on device status are conducted separately and independently. The comprehensive use of equipment status, operational performance, and risk assessment techniques to formulate optimized maintenance decisions requires urgent consideration. Consequently, it is necessary to establish fault diagnosis, risk warning, and performance evaluation models based on the integration of equipment mechanisms and real-time data \\[[22](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#bib22)\\]. Digital-twin technology can automatically raise alerts about equipment faults and predict performance conditions. This enables the integrated operation and maintenance control of equipment functions, performance, and risks, and achieves closed-loop management of equipment throughout the entire lifecycle. By constructing a data-driven digital-twin failure model, it is possible to gradually expand the available dataset, achieve fault-tolerant, self-learning, and self-organizing parallel processing, and establish a digital-twin inference and decision-making mechanism that integrates mechanisms with data.\n\n## 3\\. Intelligent safe operation and maintenance technology for oil and gas production systems\n\nWe have established a six-stage intelligent safe operation and maintenance technology for oil and gas production systems ([Fig. 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#fig3)). Starting by solving practical problems, the system clarifies the core elements, realizes the main functions, and solves key tasks. Six key technologies are employed to support the construction of the system, allowing five main tasks to be achieved. The system has four analytical capabilities, including three core elements that complete two major directional changes and ultimately achieve a basic goal. From this, a bottom-up intelligent and safe operation and maintenance technology for oil and gas production systems is formed.\n\n![Fig. 3](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2352854023000347-gr3.jpg)\n\n1.

[Download : Download full-size image](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2352854023000347-gr3.jpg \"Download full-size image\")\n\nFig. 3. Intelligent safe operation and maintenance technology for oil and gas production system.\n\n### 3.1. Fundamental goal\n\nThe fundamental goal of intelligent safe operation and maintenance is to provide a solution for safety assurance, quality assurance, and efficiency improvement of the entire oil and gas production system. This is achieved through standardized, digitized, visualized, automated, and intelligent management methods. By developing a unified intelligent safe operation and maintenance platform, it is possible to realize unified monitoring and judgment, unified linkage and emergency response, and unified processing to enhance the level of operation and maintenance management.\n\n### 3.2. Major directional changes\n\nUsing industrial internet technology and artificial intelligence, an intelligent safe operation and maintenance system needs to complete the following two technological transformations: ① from sensory-based to data-based equipment condition identification; and ② from experience-based to knowledge-based decision-making. By shifting from manual production scheduling, diagnosis, inspection, and empirical judgment to automatic push, intelligent diagnosis, intelligent inspection, and intelligent analysis, the operation and maintenance efficiency and accuracy can be effectively enhanced.\n\n### 3.3. Core elements\n\nThe core elements of intelligent safe operation and maintenance technology are reflected in the following aspects: ① Data perception is similar to the five sensory functions of humans, that is, external information is obtained through sensing technology. ② The algorithm is equivalent to the human brain and can analyze and judge external information through mechanism models, data-driven models, and other technologies. ③ A software platform is equivalent to a human body, supporting the transformation of business applications towards a “modular, iterative” industrial application model. The three are interrelated and mutually supportive, with the data perception as the foundation, algorithm patterns as the core, and software platforms as the carriers.\n\n### 3.4. Analytical capabilities\n\nThe four analysis capabilities of intelligent safe operation and maintenance include: ① Real-time monitoring: By using a multi-dimensional space-air-ground monitoring system, it is possible to comprehensively perceive the [operational risks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/operational-risk \"Learn more about operational risks from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of oil and gas production systems, visually analyze the operational status, and achieve data aggregation and statistical analysis. ② Diagnostic evaluation: By utilizing intelligent modeling methods such as big data and mechanism models, it is possible to comprehensively analyze factors that affect equipment operation status, economy, and reliability, and accurately diagnose and evaluate health and abnormal conditions. ③ Predictive warning: By analyzing the possibility and timing of future anomalies, early warnings can be issued to identify the type and location of anomalies. ④ Maintenance decisions: By analyzing big data on operations and maintenance, optimization decision-making methods can be established, scientific and reasonable maintenance decisions and emergency handling suggestions can be provided, and the level of intelligence in operations and maintenance can be enhanced.\n\n### 3.5. Primary tasks\n\nThe main tasks of intelligent safe operation and maintenance systems include: ① Equipment monitoring and maintenance. The normal and stable operation of equipment and facilities is crucial for oil and gas production, and intelligent safe operation and maintenance systems can provide technical support for the monitoring, warning, diagnosis, and evaluation of key equipment on the production site. ② Process safety warnings. Oil and gas production systems involve complex processes and have high safety requirements. An intelligent safe operation and maintenance system must have the ability to detect and independently handle abnormal events in the production process in a timely manner. ③ Risk assessment. The risks inherent to oil and gas production change dynamically. Multiple risk inferences require intelligent safe operation and maintenance systems to carry out key risk control and provide emergency response measures to minimize the possibility of accidents during the operation process. ④ Intelligent analysis and decision-making. Big data management, integration, and intelligent decision analysis should be realized through oil and gas production data detection and analysis, providing technical support for oil and gas production system operation and maintenance. ⑤ Self-operation and maintenance of the system. The operation and maintenance system should have the ability to withstand abnormal events through the process of determining, defending, attributing, and tuning its own safety threats.\n\n### 3.6. Key technologies\n\nCovering knowledge engineering, machine learning, edge computing, digital twins, big data, system development, and other key technologies, safety operation and maintenance provides basic technical support for the intrinsic safety, quality, and efficiency of oil and gas production systems. The implementation framework is based on the six key technologies shown in [Fig. 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#fig4). By fully leveraging the advantages of each key technology, the key elements of oil and gas production will be empowered, thereby achieving safety assurance, quality assurance, and efficiency improvements.\n\n![Fig. 4](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2352854023000347-gr4.jpg)\n\n1.

Framework diagram for intelligent safe operation and maintenance of oil and gas production systems.\n\nBig data technology includes system informatization data processing, external cross-border data, and industrial internet-of-things data integration. The integration of data analysis, data science, and automation can be achieved using machine learning technology. Big data technology and machine learning technology can enhance the analytical and computational capabilities of digital-twin technology, which emphasizes the consistency of data sources throughout the entire lifecycle of the system. The accuracy of product descriptions is ensured by digital twin, thus providing technical support for the full lifecycle operation and maintenance of oil and gas production systems, and realizing full lifecycle operation monitoring. System development based on platform technologies such as microservice containerization and data middleware can be used to develop industrial intelligent application development frameworks, creating a flexible and open intelligent business environment. The advantages of knowledge engineering, such as high visualization, strong correlation analysis, and identification of hidden relationships, facilitate the analysis, reasoning, and decision-making on specific problems. Knowledge engineering technology can be used to form domain knowledge bases, while edge-computing technology can be used to provide convergent network, computing, and storage capacity. Finally, the application of intelligent safe operation and maintenance technology in oil and gas production systems can be realized in terms of real-time monitoring, early warning, risk assessment, and other functions.\n\n## 4\\. Typical application of intelligent safe operation and maintenance technology for oil and gas production\n\nThe close connection between the upstream, midstream, and downstream industrial chains means that oil and gas production has a distinct structure and transmission effect. Typical production scenarios include drilling and extraction, storage and transportation, and refining and [chemical engineering](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/chemical-engineering \"Learn more about chemical engineering from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") in the upstream, midstream, and downstream. Intelligent safe operation and maintenance technology can be used to achieve status monitoring, health management, risk assessment, visual management, intelligent warning, and risk prediction.\n\n### 4.1. Oil and gas drilling and production\n\nThe drilling and exploration of hydrocarbons in deep formations, deep water, and unconventional oil and gas resources involve complex processes and harsh working conditions. Oil and gas drilling and exploration operations are susceptible to multiple coupling accidents in harsh environments (e.g., high temperatures, high pressures, acidity, and open seas), posing great challenges for early warning and emergency rescue \\[[23](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#bib23)\\]. Through intelligent safe operation and maintenance technology, intelligent fitting of reservoir models and intelligent warning of oil and gas production safety can be achieved. This will improve the level of drilling and production technology, ensure the safety of oil and gas production systems, and help prevent accidents.\n\nBased on intelligent safe operation and maintenance technology, the collaborative construction of drilling and mining sites, ground/underground integration, and geological engineering integration can be carried out so as to improve the level of drilling, mining, operation, and maintenance. By developing an integrated intelligent safe operation and maintenance platform for oil and gas drilling and exploration, real-time and comprehensive perception can be achieved on oil and gas production sites, thereby transforming production and operation methods and minimizing operational costs and risks. By creating a virtual environment for drilling and development, it is possible to build comprehensive datasets and realize full connection of drilling and production data. This enables intelligent and safe operation and maintenance of oil and gas drilling and production scenarios based on multi-discipline, multi-dimensional, multi-temporal, real-time and complete global data. By utilizing intelligent safe operation and maintenance technology to establish a data analysis and intelligent diagnosis system, real-time data on vibration, temperature, pressure, flow rate, and other key equipment can be obtained. Through fault prediction analysis, it is possible to accurately determine the cause of a fault, study methods for identifying abnormal operating conditions in the oil and gas drilling and exploration process, and conduct safety evaluations of the extraction process. Thus, intelligent risk classification and control can be achieved, and potential problems can be identified in advance.\n\n### 4.2. Oil and gas storage and transportation\n\nIn the field of oil and gas storage and transportation, pipeline leakages are generally identified by monitoring changes in parameters such as pressure and flow rate. The leakage monitoring capabilities need to be improved. A lack of derivative disaster assessment models for oil and gas pipelines and stations means that the accuracy of risk assessment predictions is low. Systematic integrity evaluation methods are yet to be developed for the inspection and maintenance of storage tanks \\[[24](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#bib24)\\]. To solve these problems, intelligent safe operation and maintenance technologies are required. By formulating a reasonable operation and maintenance plan, simulating and analyzing the decision-making effect, and tracking and managing the decision-making implementation process, it is possible to reduce the decision-making risk, improve the macro decision analysis ability, achieve [predictive maintenance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/predictive-maintenance \"Learn more about predictive maintenance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), effectively cut maintenance costs, and minimize the risk of unplanned downtime.\n\nIntelligent safe operation and maintenance technology should make the oil and gas storage and transportation process safer in terms of process risk evolution, real-time risk perception, intelligent warning technology, and key facility health monitoring. To address the challenges of risk monitoring and early warning in the oil and gas storage and transportation process, a remote monitoring and predictive maintenance platform combining edge-cloud technology is required, integrating business data and spatial data. Based on perception, computation, and modeling, it is possible to achieve interactive mapping between physical and virtual spaces for intelligent applications. By fully utilizing monitoring data in actual production, intelligent safe operation and maintenance technology can analyze key hydraulic and thermal processes during oil and gas storage and transportation. The analysis of big data allows such a system to achieve rapid and accurate fault diagnosis, timely risk warning, and real-time process monitoring, as well as improving the safety of the entire process of oil and gas storage and transportation.\n\n### 4.3. Oil and gas refining and chemical engineering\n\nOil and [gas refining](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/natural-gas-processing \"Learn more about gas refining from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and chemical engineering suffers from resource dispersion and lack of coordination, partly because of the large production scale and complex processes of large refining enterprises. In addition, the refining process is complex, and operational control is difficult because of the involvement of flammable and explosive materials. Therefore, the safety problems associated with refining have gradually developed into a complex problem involving multiple media \\[[25](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#bib25)\\]. Conventional operation and maintenance technology not only improves the production efficiency and management efficiency of refining and chemical enterprises, but also introduces safety hazards.\n\nBy creating a real-time model of a refinery, intelligent safe operation and maintenance technology can provide dynamic alerts driven by virtual and real data synchronization. Personnel in the accident area can receive alerts and evacuation guidance, while initiating an accident response mechanism. To address the difficulty of risk warning for key refining equipment, digital-twin technology and big data can be combined to establish a digital-twin model for equipment. This enables dynamic warnings driven by virtual and real data synchronization. Based on real-time mapping and virtual sensing technology, complex fault diagnosis and tracing technology can address the problem of fault diagnosis and management faced by refining equipment, achieving virtual and real fusion diagnosis and early warning. To manage the health of refining equipment, a multi-source monitoring [data feature](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/datum-feature \"Learn more about data feature from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") indicator system can be established based on big data, exploring the implicit relationship between feature indicators and equipment deterioration status. Such a system could also construct an equipment health assessment scale and understand equipment health conditions in real time.\n\n## 5\\. Development trend of intelligent safe operation and maintenance technology\n\nAt present, the safety of oil and gas production systems includes not only the safety of physical equipment, but also changes in the comprehensive situation of the system caused by network attacks and data anomalies. The diversified characteristics of production safety risks increase the difficulty of identifying potential risks, and make the safety situation more severe. These technological and situational changes have led to the development of intelligent safe operation and maintenance towards intelligent decision-making, proactive prevention, and comprehensive information and physical safety.\n\n### 5.1. Development of safe operation and maintenance towards intelligent decision making\n\nIntelligent safe operation and maintenance can identify safety risks that may pose a threat to system safety, with big data technology used to analyze massive amounts of security data. However, there are issues with unclear safety risk elements and risk evolution mechanisms in the analysis of functional components or application layers of the system. Thus, there is no theoretical framework for describing the cross-domain risk transmission and evolution of oil and gas production systems. Intelligent safe operation and maintenance should develop towards intelligent perception, data chain utilization, and intelligent decision-making. By conducting logical and knowledge-based reasoning, difficult-to-measure physical quantities can be estimated, potential security threats can be predicted and judged, and the accurate warning and handling of security risks can be improved.\n\n### 5.2. Transition from risk monitoring to proactive prevention\n\nAbnormal operation of the oil and gas production system itself can lead to data anomalies. Therefore, accurately detecting system abnormal behavior and confirming the source is the key to active detection and defense. A lack of information updates has led to uncertainties and low accuracy levels in long-term forecasting. In intelligent safe operation and maintenance systems, the transformation from passive safety protection to proactive defense can be realized by establishing active prevention safety technology. By utilizing mixed perception information and risk prediction models, intelligent safety reasoning and decision-making techniques for oil and gas production systems can be implemented, risk factors can be identified, and different levels of risk factor system frameworks can be constructed. Elaborating on the basic forms of risk formation and evolution propagation enables comprehensive and effective diagnosis and accurate prediction of oil and gas production and operation.\n\n### 5.3. Evolution from system safety to comprehensive information physical safety\n\nThe information safety threat to oil and gas production information systems interacts with engineering safety risks to the physical system, creating a systemic comprehensive security problem. The unclear coupling mechanism and control factors mean that there is a lack of active defense and control techniques. Therefore, intelligent safe operation and maintenance should clarify the information–physical coupling mechanism, reveal the cross-domain risk evolution, and construct a perception/evaluation strategy. By establishing an [anomaly detection](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/anomaly-detection \"Learn more about anomaly detection from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and warning technique for oil and gas production systems under information–physical interactions, a theoretical and methodological system for risk analysis and control can be formed. This is of great significance in the development of intelligent safe operation and maintenance technology.\n\n## 6\\. Conclusions\n\nThere is an urgent need for the digital transformation of oil and gas production, operation, and maintenance. Thus, it is necessary to study the integration and application of new-generation information technologies in intelligent oil and gas safe production, establish intelligent safe operation and maintenance technology, and improve the level of intelligent safe operation and maintenance. These are the inevitable trends for improving the quality and efficiency of oil and gas production and promoting green transformation and development.\n\nKey technologies such as knowledge engineering, machine learning, edge computing, digital twin, big data, and system development can be combined to build an intelligent safe operation and maintenance technology for oil and gas production systems. Encouraging intelligent decision-making, proactive prevention, and comprehensive intelligent safe operation and maintenance will promote the digital upgrading of conventional oil and gas production systems, the development of digital and intelligent oil and gas production operation and maintenance methods, and build a new model of intelligent safe operation and maintenance.\n\nOil and gas production enterprises should vigorously develop intelligent and safe operation and maintenance, not only ensuring their own energy production and supply, but also effectively responding to international market competition. In a significant global economic recession and faced with the long-term instability of international oil prices, vigorously promoting the intelligent transformation of the oil and gas industry has prominent strategic and practical significance. Taking the intelligent and safe operation and maintenance of oil and gas production as a basis, relevant research can provide references for the intelligent development of the world's oil and gas industry, promote intelligent manufacturing services for industrial enterprises, and accelerate the digital and intelligent transformation of the manufacturing industry. This is of great significance in both economic and national security terms.\n\n## Funding\n\nThis research was supported by the Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China “Research on risk formation mechanism and control method of oil & gas storage and transportation system from the perspective of cyber-physics” (No.: [52234007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854023000347#gs1)).\n---\ncreated: 2023-09-21T15:52:02 (UTC +01:00)\ntags: []\nsource: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440\nauthor: Z.T.

While, ineffective control of ventilation and purification systems can result in increased energy consumption and cross-contamination. This paper is to develop intelligent operation, maintenance, and control systems by coupling intelligent ventilation and air purification systems (negative ion generators). Optimal deployment of sensors is determined by Fuzzy C-mean (FCM), based on which CO<sub>2</sub> concentration fields are rapidly predicted by combing the artificial neural network (ANN) and self-adaptive low-dimensional linear model (LLM). Negative oxygen ion and particle concentrations are simulated with different numbers of negative ion generators. Optimal ventilation rates and number of negative ion generators are decided. A visualization platform is established to display the effects of ventilation control, epidemic prevention, and pollutant removal. The rapid prediction error of LLM-based ANN for CO<sub>2</sub> concentration was below 10% compared with the simulation. Fast decision reduced CO<sub>2</sub> concentration below 1000 ppm, infection risk below 1.5%, and energy consumption by 27.4%.

This work can promote intelligent operation, maintenance, and control systems considering infection prevention and energy sustainability.\n\n-   [Previous](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001312)\n-   [Next](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001294)\n\n## Keywords\n\nPublic building environment\n\nIntelligent operation, maintenance and control system\n\nVentilation\n\nAir purification\n\nInfection risk\n\nEnergy efficiency\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nWith the global urbanization, the building area is rapidly increasing, especially for public buildings ([Huang et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0018)). Enormous energy and resource consumption are accompanied by the rapid development of the building industry ([Su et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0041)). Building energy consumption has accounted for around 40% of global energy consumption, which has been the key to energy conservation and low-carbon development ([Chen et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0004)). The regulation of energy consumption in public buildings is conducive to the sustainable construction and development of urban cities ([Ma et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0025)). Public buildings can improve the building energy efficiency through operation, maintenance, and control of energy-intensive units, such as ventilation systems ([Gupta et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0016)). While, a major task of the ventilation system is to provide the adequate ventilation rates to dilute the indoor pollutants. If energy efficiency is improved at the expense of indoor environmental quality, it can potentially lead to a series of emergent incidents of building environment, such as transmission of infectious disease and transfer of outdoor pollutants (naturally/mechanically), which can seriously threaten the building occupants’ health and cause the incalculable loss ([Rohde et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0037)). Therefore, indoor environment improvement and energy conservation are both core objectives of operation, maintenance, and control system for public buildings. Particularly, global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses a challenge to the regulation of safe and healthy environment, and energy-saving building ([Ding et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0007)).\n\nThe essential task of developing operation, maintenance, and control system for public building environment is to reduce the pollutant concentration (e.g., CO<sub>2</sub>, particulate matter), infection risk, and energy consumption. Intelligent ventilation and air purification are both important to control the pollutant exposure level ([Feng et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0010); [Zhu et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0048)), which provide the key technologies for the operation, maintenance, and control of indoor environment.\n\n### 1.1. Intelligent ventilation system\n\nFor public buildings with the high density and mobility of people, indoor pollutants are generated by a number of sources (e.g., indoor occupants, furnishing and building material, cosmetic and cleaning products, and outdoor sources), which can present the non-uniform, dynamic, and complex distribution characteristics ([Feng et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0009)). Using the traditional ventilation systems with constant supply air parameters may result in the local accumulation of pollutants, cross-infection, and energy waste ([Ren et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0035)). To address these problems, intelligent control of building ventilation systems is significant based on non-uniform and dynamic pollutant distribution, namely intelligent ventilation system. Its essence is (i) _how to rapidly obtain indoor pollutant distributions,_ and (ii) _how to implement fast decision and intelligent control?_\n\nTraditional prediction methods for indoor environment such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) require a long computation time and cannot be used directly for online control. Using a number of monitoring sensors to obtain the non-uniform indoor environment is usually accompanied by data duplication and high costs ([Kumar et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0019)). It is urgent to develop rapid prediction models for non-uniform and dynamic distributions of pollutants, by using the scientific deployment strategy of limited monitoring sensors as input boundaries. [Ren and Cao (2019)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0036) incorporated monitoring techniques into the low-dimensional linear model (LLM) and artificial neural network (ANN) to predict pollutant concentration efficiently, and found that well-deployed sensors could provide the satisfying inputs for rapid prediction. [Cao et al. (2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0003) developed a systematic method of sensor deployment for efficient prediction of indoor environment using Fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering method. However, these studies did not apply the deployment strategy of limited sensors or rapid prediction models to real-life ventilation systems in buildings.\n\nThe decision of conventional ventilation systems commonly depends on a single-point or limited monitoring data for direct evaluation and control, which cannot effectively represent the non-uniform distribution of indoor pollutant, potentially leading to ineffective decision making ([Merema et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0026)). Thus, the aim of fast decision for ventilation systems should be implementing the scientific evaluation and control (combined with controller) based on the rapid prediction of pollutant distribution, to effectively reduce pollutant exposure level and infection risk, and also minimize energy consumption. [Ren and Cao (2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0032) developed a faster-than-real-time prediction model (low-dimensional linear ventilation model, LLVM) to predict the non-uniform pollutant concentration fields, and evaluated the ventilation performance with energy efficiency and pollutant level reduced by 43% and 28% after the decision when compared with that before the decision, respectively. However, no earlier studies have synthetically considered the feasibility of fast decision and control systems (strategies) in real building application.\n\nGenerally, intelligent ventilation system should consist of “limited monitoring system”, “rapid prediction model”, and “fast decision making”. Therefore, it is of necessity to explore the application of intelligent ventilation system to the actual public building environment.\n\n### 1.2. Air purification system\n\nRegarding the air purification system, air filters or ultraviolet (UV) lamps are usually used to remove indoor pollutant ([Feng et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0011)). High efficiency particulate air filter (HEPA) can approach to about 100% of removal efficiency for particles, yet some shortcomings still be found. (1) The accumulation of particles can result in high pressure drop, which would increase the energy consumption and replacement costs for fiber filters ([Li et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0021)). (2) Bacteria and viruses can multiply in fiber filter with the re-atomization and bio-release potential, which can cause secondary contamination and health risk ([Nakpan et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0027)). UV lamps have the function of disinfection to inactivate pollutants such as bacteria and viruses. However, UV lamps almost have no purification ability to remove the particles ([Fischer et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0012)). Moreover, air filters and UV lamps are ineffective against the pollutants that settle on walls, and are usually applied to indoor microenvironments ([D'Orazio & D'Alessandro, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0008)). To this end, portable air purification system, such as negative ion generator, is developed for effective removal of indoor pollutants (especially particles).\n\nThe negative ion generator can release a large number of negative oxygen ions through carbon fiber electrode ([Pushpawela et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0030)). Negative oxygen ions can electrically charge the particles, causing them to either repel each other or remove them by a deposition process ([Pushpawela et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0030)). Considering the spatial accessibility of negative oxygen ions, negative ion generators could effectively remove the pollutants from indoor air and indoor environment surfaces. [Pushpawela et al. (2017)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0030) measured the efficiency of a negative ion generator in removing ultrafine particles from an indoor chamber, and found that 70% of particles were removed within 15 min. [Grabarczyk (2001)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0015) used ionizers in an unventilated and unoccupied room, and found that the particle concentrations reduced by up to two orders of magnitude after 2 h for the particles in the size range of 0.3–2.5 μm. However, the major drawback of negative ion generators is the potential harmful effect on building occupant's health ([Ren et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0034)). Generally, it is suggested to use negative ion generators without the appearance of occupants, considering their side effects on health ([Ren et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0034)).\n\nIn buildings, the air purification system's layout strategy (e.g., location and number) has been optimally designed to efficiently remove indoor pollutants. For example, [Yu et al. (2017)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0044) analyzed the pollutant concentration after installing air purification device, and evaluated their optimal locations. [Shiue et al. (2011)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0040) evaluated the particle removal efficiencies at different installation heights of negative ion generator in a closed room, showing the maximum particle removal efficiency at the installation height of 60 cm from the floor. Most studies considered the effect of independently using the air purification system, yet usually ignored the impact of indoor ventilation on the air purification efficiency. For public buildings, investigating the coupling performance of intelligent ventilation and air purification systems is beneficial to operation, maintenance, and control for safe and healthy environments, and energy-efficient building.\n\n### 1.3. Research framework\n\nThis study aims to develop the integrated and intelligent operation, maintenance, and control system for safe and healthy indoor environment, and energy efficient public buildings, through coupling intelligent ventilation and air purification system. This work systematically integrates the limited monitoring technology, rapid prediction model, and fast decision making into a real building scenario.\n\nThe research framework is presented in [Fig. 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#fig0001). First, different layout strategies (different numbers and locations) of monitoring sensors are determined, and the experiment is performed to validate the simulation model. Second, rapid prediction of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration fields is achieved and validated by CFD simulation, based on which the optimal deployment of sensors is evaluated. Third, the optimal supply air velocity and the number of negative ion generators are evaluated by using fast decision. Fourth, online regulation of intelligent ventilation and air purification system is achieved based on optimal evaluation, and a visualization platform of intelligent operation, maintenance, and control system is constructed to show the actual implementation effectiveness.\n\n![Fig 1](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2210670723001440-gr1.jpg)\n\n1.

(For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)\n\n## 2\\. Materials and methods\n\nThis study uses a numerical simulation method to model the velocity, pollutant concentration fields, and distributions of negative oxygen ions. For intelligent ventilation system, online monitoring and experiment are first carried out. Fuzzy C-means (FCM) is used to determine the deployment strategy of limited sensors. The rapid prediction models, including low-dimensional linear model (LLM) and artificial neural network (ANN, using limited monitoring data as inputs), are used to predict the non-uniform pollutant concentration fields rapidly. The fast decisions for optimal supply air velocity are proposed by evaluating the ventilation performance based on analytic hierarchy process (AHP). For air purification system, different layout strategies of negative ion generators are defined, and the fast decision based on the removal efficiency is proposed for optimal number of negative ion generators. The framework of intelligent operation, maintenance, and control system is finally developed.\n\n### 2.1. Building model setup\n\nThe front hall of the International Convention and Exhibition Center (a public building) in Nanjing is selected for the intelligent operation, maintenance, and control of indoor environment. [Fig. 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#fig0002) shows the photo and geometry of the front hall, with a floor area of 292 m<sup>2</sup> and a height of 15 m. The hall is equipped with a variable air volume system for the intelligent ventilation, with an outdoor air volume (OAV) accounting for 32% of the total flow rate. The intelligent ventilation system is mainly used to control indoor pollutant level (e.g., CO<sub>2</sub>). The ventilation mode is mixing ventilation (MV) with nine circular supply air inlets and one louvered return air outlet placed in the ceiling. The radius of an inlet is 0.2 m, and the size of an outlet is 2.00 m × 0.96 m. The number of people (_N<sub>p</sub>_) to be accommodated in the hall is between 0 and 100. According to an OAV of 30 m<sup>3</sup>/h per person ([GB50736-2012, 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0014)), the maximum supply air volume is set as 9300 m<sup>3</sup>/h, with an inlet velocity (_V<sub>in</sub>_) corresponding to 2.3 m/s. The _V<sub>in</sub>_ values of 0.7 and 1.5 m/s are also considered, and the supply air temperature is constant at 24 °C (summer condition).\n\n![Fig 2](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2210670723001440-gr2.jpg)\n\n1.

(a) Photo and (b) geometry of the front hall in the International Convention and Exhibition Center. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)\n\nThe air purification system in the front hall is used to enhance the removal effects of pollutants (i.e., particles), and it is further combined with intelligent ventilation system. In this study, negative ion generator (KT03-A01) is applied to remove particles, with the size of 98 mm (length) × 72 mm (width) × 225 mm (height). A number of negative ion generators are arranged along the walls with a height of 0.5 m from the floor. The setup of negative ion generator is detailed in [Section 2.4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#sec0012).\n\n### 2.2. Numerical simulation\n\nCFD is used to simulate the airflow and distribution of pollutants (e.g., CO<sub>2</sub> and particles), to illustrate the effectiveness of integrated intelligent ventilation and air purification systems. All simulations are performed at steady-state assuming incompressible using ANSYS FLUENT 16.0. The Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) method is used, and the _Re_\\-Normalization Group (RNG) k-ε model is used for the turbulence modeling because of its great performance of airflow simulation ([Ren et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0033)). Based on the airflow simulation, the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration is simulated by the species transport equation.(1)$<math><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">∇</mi><mrow is=\"true\"><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">(</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">ρ</mi><mi mathvariant=\"bold-italic\" is=\"true\">u</mi><mi is=\"true\">C</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">)</mo></mrow><mo linebreak=\"goodbreak\" is=\"true\">=</mo><mi is=\"true\">∇</mi><mrow is=\"true\"><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">[</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">ρ</mi><mrow is=\"true\"><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">(</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">D</mi><mo linebreak=\"badbreak\" is=\"true\">+</mo><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">υ</mi><mi is=\"true\">C</mi></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">)</mo></mrow><mi is=\"true\">∇</mi><mi is=\"true\">C</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">]</mo></mrow><mo linebreak=\"goodbreak\" is=\"true\">+</mo><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">S</mi><mi is=\"true\">C</mi></msub></mrow></math>$where, _C_ is the species concentration for CO<sub>2</sub> (ppm); _ρ_ is the density (kg/m<sup>3</sup>); **_u_** is the velocity (m/s); _D_ is the diffusion coefficient (m<sup>2</sup>/s); $<math><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">υ</mi><mi is=\"true\">C</mi></msub></math>$ is the turbulent diffusion coefficient (m<sup>2</sup>/s); and _S<sub>C</sub>_ is the source term. For particulate pollutant, fine particles (i.e., PM<sub>2.5</sub>, typical particle size existing in indoor environment) are considered in this study. Considering that modeling particles as gaseous pollutants (continuous phase) is acceptable when the particle diameter is below 3.5 μm according to [Ai and Melikov (2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0001)), the particle concentration is simulated using a user-defined scalar (UDS) function by solving the species transport equation based on the airflow simulation, shown in [Eq. (2)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#eqn0002). The simulations of CO<sub>2</sub> and particle are assumed decoupled in this study.(2)$<math><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">∇</mi><mrow is=\"true\"><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">[</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><mrow is=\"true\"><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">(</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><mi mathvariant=\"bold-italic\" is=\"true\">u</mi><mo linebreak=\"badbreak\" is=\"true\">+</mo><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">u</mi><mi is=\"true\">s</mi></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">)</mo></mrow><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">C</mi><mi is=\"true\">P</mi></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">]</mo></mrow><mo linebreak=\"goodbreak\" is=\"true\">=</mo><mi is=\"true\">∇</mi><mrow is=\"true\"><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">[</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><mrow is=\"true\"><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">(</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">D</mi><mo linebreak=\"badbreak\" is=\"true\">+</mo><msub is=\"true\"><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">ε</mi></mrow><mi is=\"true\">p</mi></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">)</mo></mrow><mi is=\"true\">∇</mi><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">C</mi><mi is=\"true\">P</mi></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">]</mo></mrow><mo linebreak=\"goodbreak\" is=\"true\">−</mo><mi is=\"true\">A</mi><mi is=\"true\">n</mi><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">C</mi><mi is=\"true\">P</mi></msub></mrow></math>$where, _C<sub>p</sub>_ is the particle concentration (#/m<sup>3</sup>); _u<sub>s</sub>_ is the settling velocity of particles (m/s); _ε<sub>p</sub>_ is the particle eddy diffusivity (m<sup>2</sup>/s); _n_ is the number of negative oxygen ions (#/cm<sup>3</sup>); and _A_ is the removal coefficient of negative oxygen ions, which is equal to 1 × 10<sup>−7</sup> cm<sup>3</sup>/#. An oxygen ion is assumed to carry a negative charge. Potential and electrical fields are solved by Poisson and Gaussian equations, respectively. Negative oxygen ion is simulated by continuous phase model, as follows.(3)$<math><mrow is=\"true\"><mrow is=\"true\"><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">(</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><mi mathvariant=\"bold-italic\" is=\"true\">u</mi><mo linebreak=\"badbreak\" is=\"true\">+</mo><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">μ</mi><mi is=\"true\">i</mi></msub><mo is=\"true\">·</mo><mi is=\"true\">E</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">)</mo></mrow><mspace width=\"0.33em\" is=\"true\"></mspace><mi is=\"true\">∇</mi><mi is=\"true\">n</mi><mo linebreak=\"goodbreak\" is=\"true\">=</mo><mi is=\"true\">D</mi><msup is=\"true\"><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">∇</mi></mrow><mn is=\"true\">2</mn></msup><mi is=\"true\">n</mi></mrow></math>$where, _μ<sub>i</sub>_ is the negative oxygen ion mobility (m<sup>2</sup>/V·s); and _E_ is the electric field (V/m).\n\nIn CFD modeling, the supply inlets are defined as velocity-inlet with a uniform velocity profile, and the return outlet is set as outflow. The walls are defined as non-slip walls and insulated. In the CO<sub>2</sub> simulation, CO<sub>2</sub> release rate per person is 16.8 g/h ([Chow, 2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0005)), and _N<sub>p</sub>_ in the hall is defined as a constant of 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120. The CO<sub>2</sub> source is defined as a surface source (covering a surface area of 292 m<sup>2</sup>) located at a height of 1.7 m (the height of breathing plane). The CO<sub>2</sub> release is assumed uniform on this surface, with different CO<sub>2</sub> source densities corresponding to different values of _N<sub>p</sub>_. The CO<sub>2</sub> source is compiled by using user-defined function (UDF). In the simulation of particles, the total particle concentration (_C<sub>0</sub>_) at the inlets is defined as 11,000 #/cm<sup>3</sup> (measured by particle counter), and indoor particle concentrations are normalized by _C<sub>p</sub>_/_C<sub>0</sub>_. The modeling parameters of releasing negative oxygen ions from negative ion generators are described in [Section 2.4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#sec0012). Grid independence analysis is performed considering coarse, medium, and fine grids with the scenario of _V<sub>in</sub>_ = 0.7 m/s, and _N<sub>p</sub>_ = 20, which can be referred to [Section 3.2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#sec0018).\n\n### 2.3. Intelligent ventilation system\n\n#### 2.3.1. Online monitoring and experiment\n\nDeveloping intelligent ventilation needs the online monitoring of indoor environment to provide input boundaries for rapid prediction and fast decision. Considering the non-uniform distributions of indoor environment, a clustering algorithm of Fuzzy C-means (FCM) is applied to determine the deployment strategy of limited sensors, which can greatly improve the monitoring effectiveness, and reduce the monitoring cost (dependent on the number of sensors) ([Cao et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0003)).\n\nFCM is one of the widely applied and excellent unsupervised machine learning methods ([Cao et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0003)). It obtains the degrees of membership for each sample data to the cluster centers through optimizing the objective function, thus determining the category of sample data to automatically classify the sample set. In this study, a series of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration and velocity data (by considering different _V<sub>in</sub>_ and _N<sub>p</sub>_) are acquired by CFD simulation, and these data are normalized. The normalized concentration _C\\*_ and velocity _U\\*_ are clustered by minimizing the objective function ([Cao et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0003)). More details of FCM are shown in **Appendix A**. Next, cluster centers are defined as locations of sensors (potentially with the adjustment in engineering installation). The deployment of limited sensors in the front hall is shown in [Section 3.1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#sec0017) (with the number of sensors depending on the cluster number). The rapid prediction of non-uniform pollutant concentration fields can be achieved by inputting limited monitoring data. The optimal strategy (locations and number) is determined by comparing the rapid prediction errors under different layout strategies of sensors.\n\nThe sensors are also used for online monitoring of other environmental parameters, including temperature, velocity, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, total volatile organic compounds (TVOC), and relative humidity (RH). [Fig. 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#fig0003) displays the photo of a monitoring sensor, consisting of a particle sensor module (BITSHEEP PMS5003, ± 10%), a CO<sub>2</sub> sensor module (SenseAir S8, ± 3%), a velocity transducer (W410C2, ± 0.02 m/s), a TVOC sensor module (AMS IAQ-CORE C, ± 5%), a temperature and humidity sensor module (SENSIRION SHT20, ± 0.5 °C and ± 4% for RH), and a wireless transmission module (WH-LTE-7S1). TVOC is consisted of benzene series, organic chlorides, freon series, organic ketones, amines, alcohols, ethers, esters, acids and petroleum hydrocarbon compounds, which are usually emitted from chemicals, cleaning agents, building materials, and furnishings ([Zhang & Zhang, 2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0045)). Thus, particular attention should be paid on the determination of concentrations of TVOC. The online monitoring sensors can transmit the data to the web server by the LTE Cat-1 and GPRS networks, setting the interval of recording and transmitting the data as 30 min. By collecting the video data from the surveillance cameras in the hall and adopting the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm ([Wang et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0042)), real-time detection of _N<sub>p</sub>_ is achieved. The schematic of YOLO algorithm can be found in [Wang et al. (2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0042)).\n\n![Fig 3](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2210670723001440-gr3.jpg)\n\n1.

(For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)\n\nExperimental measurement is carried out using the monitoring sensors to verify the simulation model. Three _V<sub>in</sub>_ are considered in the experiment, and the measured parameters includes the velocity and CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. The measurement points are the locations of 3 monitoring sensors, shown in [Section 3.1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#sec0017). For _V<sub>in</sub>_, the measurement duration is 9 h, and _N<sub>p</sub>_ is recorded with the interval of 30 min. The inlet CO<sub>2</sub> (background) concentration is measured to be 400 ppm, which is used in the simulation.\n\n#### 2.3.2. Rapid prediction models\n\nRapid prediction models are used to predict the non-uniform distributions of indoor environment for fast decision and control of intelligent ventilation system. Low-dimensional linear model (LLM) is constructed for rapid prediction of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, including low-dimensional model (LM, reducing the data dimensionality and storage capacity of the database) and linear model (reducing the construction cost of the database) ([Ren & Cao, 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0031)). LM consists of uniform LM and self-adaptive non-uniform LM. Linear model is used to rapidly expand the database based on LM.\n\n[Fig. 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#fig0004) illustrates the schematic diagram for uniform LM and self-adaptive non-uniform LM. To reduce the system's dimensionality, “sub-layer division and recomposition” algorithm is proposed to determine the division point set _P<sub>d</sub>_ of _d_ (_d_ = X_,_ Y, and Z) direction \\[including one zero point, one full-length point, and (_N<sub>d</sub>_ −1) middle points; _N<sub>d</sub>_ is the division number of _d_ direction\\]. Details of LM steps are shown in **Appendix B**. The _N<sub>d</sub>_ in direction _d_ of non-uniform LM is same as that of uniform LM. In this study, the performance of two LMs is compared, and the calculation method for discretization error _ε_ is also defined, as shown in Eq. B5 in **Appendix B**.\n\n![Fig 4](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2210670723001440-gr4.jpg)\n\n1.

Schematic diagram of low-dimensional model (LM) consisting of uniform LM and self-adaptive non-uniform LM. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)\n\nThe linear model is used to superimpose linearly the scalar fields generated by any source within the steady-state airflow ([Ren & Cao, 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0031)). For example, when multiple pollutant sources exist in the room, indoor pollutant concentration fields generated by multiple sources are equal to the linear superpositions of those generated by a single source. Compared with the simulation, linear model can effectively reduce the database construction cost used for prediction, and improve the efficiency of rapid prediction. The discretization error _ε_ is also used to validate the LLM.\n\nBased on the LLM, artificial neural network (ANN) model with autonomous learning function is used to improve the rapid prediction effect of indoor environment, responding to limited monitoring data ([Zhang & You, 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0046)). In this study, radial basis function (RBF) network with better approximation and learning ability is applied to train and predict low-dimensional and non-uniform pollutant concentration fields. We construct a database for ANN training with monitored CO<sub>2</sub> concentration and velocity under different values of _V<sub>in</sub>_ and _N<sub>p</sub>_ as inputs, and the low-dimensional CO<sub>2</sub> concentration fields as outputs. Firstly, the output data in the initial database are derived from the cases with _V<sub>in</sub>_ of 0.7, 1.5, and 2.3 m/s and _N<sub>p</sub>_ of 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120, which are high-resolution data from CFD simulation. Then, the recomposition of low-dimensional database is obtained by LM. Finally, the database is expanded by the linear model to obtain the low-dimensional data with the scenarios of _V<sub>in</sub>_ = 0.7, 1.5, and 2.3 m/s, and _N<sub>p</sub>_ = 10, 30, 70, 90, and 110. After training the ANN, the simulation case with _V<sub>in</sub>_ = 0.7 m/s and _N<sub>p</sub>_ = 50 is applied to validate the rapid prediction model with monitoring data from different layouts of sensor as inputs. The prediction errors are calculated as follows to determine the optimal layout.(4)$<math><mrow is=\"true\"><mtext is=\"true\">MAPE</mtext><mo linebreak=\"goodbreak\" is=\"true\">=</mo><mfrac is=\"true\"><mrow is=\"true\"><msubsup is=\"true\"><mo is=\"true\">∑</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">S</mi><mo is=\"true\">=</mo><mn is=\"true\">1</mn></mrow><mi is=\"true\">N</mi></msubsup><msub is=\"true\"><mstyle mathvariant=\"normal\" is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">Ω</mi></mstyle><mi is=\"true\">S</mi></msub><mrow is=\"true\"><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">|</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">C</mi><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">C</mi><mi is=\"true\">F</mi><mi is=\"true\">D</mi><mo is=\"true\">−</mo><mi is=\"true\">L</mi><mi is=\"true\">L</mi><mi is=\"true\">M</mi><mo is=\"true\">,</mo><mi is=\"true\">S</mi></mrow></msub><mo is=\"true\">−</mo><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">C</mi><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">A</mi><mi is=\"true\">N</mi><mi is=\"true\">N</mi><mo is=\"true\">,</mo><mi is=\"true\">S</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">|</mo></mrow><mo is=\"true\">/</mo><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">C</mi><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">A</mi><mi is=\"true\">N</mi><mi is=\"true\">N</mi><mo is=\"true\">,</mo><mi is=\"true\">S</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><mi is=\"true\">N</mi></mfrac><mo linebreak=\"goodbreak\" is=\"true\">×</mo><mspace width=\"0.33em\" is=\"true\"></mspace><mn is=\"true\">100</mn><mo is=\"true\">%</mo></mrow></math>$where, MAPE is the mean absolute percentage error for rapid prediction model; $<math><msub is=\"true\"><mstyle mathvariant=\"normal\" is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">Ω</mi></mstyle><mi is=\"true\">S</mi></msub></math>$ is the volume of zone _S_; $<math><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">C</mi><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">C</mi><mi is=\"true\">F</mi><mi is=\"true\">D</mi><mo is=\"true\">−</mo><mi is=\"true\">L</mi><mi is=\"true\">L</mi><mi is=\"true\">M</mi><mo is=\"true\">,</mo><mi is=\"true\">S</mi></mrow></msub></math>$ represents the low-dimensional CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations by CFD-based LLM in zone _S_; $<math><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">C</mi><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">A</mi><mi is=\"true\">N</mi><mi is=\"true\">N</mi><mo is=\"true\">,</mo><mi is=\"true\">S</mi></mrow></msub></math>$ is the predicted CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in zone _S; S_ is the index of divided zone; and _N_ is the total number of zone _S_.\n\n#### 2.3.3. Fast decision for controlling ventilation system\n\nThe fast decision of intelligent ventilation systems aims to evaluate the ventilation performance, and then determine the optimal ventilation rate (or _V<sub>in</sub>_). The evaluation of ventilation performance is done in terms of indoor air quality (IAQ), epidemic prevention, and ventilation energy consumption. IAQ is evaluated by CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, which is an effective bio-proxy for indicating IAQ ([Lu et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0023)). Besides, CO<sub>2</sub> can be used as a good proxy for pathogen concentration and infection risk since it is co-exhaled with the aerosols containing pathogens by infectors ([Li & Cai, 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0020)), which is described in [Eq. (5)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#eqn0005). CO<sub>2</sub> monitoring inside enclosed environment is revealing to be a practical warning to prevent airborne transmission ([Palmisani et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0028)). Total IAQ is then evaluated comprehensively based on PM<sub>2.5</sub>, TVOC, temperature, and humidity, since that IAQ is also particularly relative to the determination of TVOC, PM<sub>2.5</sub> (related to outdoor infiltration and indoor particle resuspension), and other parameters such as temperature and relative humidity ([Paterson et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0029)). Through measuring the concentrations of TVOC and PM<sub>2.5</sub>, indoor health risks (such as asthma and other bronchial diseases) and the harmful impact of giving rise to irritant odors, causing the body immune level disorder, and affecting the central nervous system can be also forewarned ([Paterson et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0029)). For the epidemic prevention, prevention effect and infection risk are assessed based on the airborne pollutant level, and then to analyze the epidemic prevention level. Ventilation energy consumption is calculated based on the cooling loads. The fast decision of the optimal _V<sub>in</sub>_ is conducted by integrated evaluation of pollutant concentration, infection risk, and energy consumption.\n\nThis study focuses on the average CO<sub>2</sub> concentration $<math><mrow is=\"true\"><mo is=\"true\">〈</mo><mi is=\"true\">C</mi><mo is=\"true\">〉</mo></mrow></math>$ (ppm) in the breathing zone (_Z_ ≤ 1.7 m) as an evaluation index for IAQ. The criterion is defined as: “$<math><mrow is=\"true\"><mo is=\"true\">〈</mo><mi is=\"true\">C</mi><mo is=\"true\">〉</mo></mrow></math>$ ≤ 800 ppm” for “Excellent”, “800 ppm < $<math><mrow is=\"true\"><mo is=\"true\">〈</mo><mi is=\"true\">C</mi><mo is=\"true\">〉</mo></mrow></math>$ ≤ 1000 ppm” for “Good”, and “$<math><mrow is=\"true\"><mo is=\"true\">〈</mo><mi is=\"true\">C</mi><mo is=\"true\">〉</mo></mrow></math>$ > 1000 ppm” for “Poor” according to [GB/T18883-2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0013). CO<sub>2</sub> concentration limit of 1000 ppm is commonly recommended in different countries standards for the management of generic IAQ concerns ([Lu et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0024)). For total IAQ, the evaluation criteria for PM<sub>2.5</sub>, TVOC, temperature, and RH are displayed in [Table 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#tbl0001) according to [GB/T18883-2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0013). The threshold of PM<sub>2.5</sub> is 50 μg/m<sup>3</sup>, which is consistent with daily average limits of PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) ([Xue et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0043)). The threshold of TVOC is set 0.6 mg/m<sup>3</sup>, which almost corresponds to the limit of 0.5 mg/m<sup>3</sup> established in different IAQ indices such as Indoor Environment Index (IEI) in Taiwan, and Indoor Air Quality Certification (IAQC) proposed by Indoor Air Quality Management Group in Hong Kong ([Zhang et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0047)). The criteria for indoor temperature and RH are also within the comfort range proposed by the American Society of Heating Refrigerating and Air conditioning Engineer (ASHRAE) ([Alghamdi et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0002)). The evaluation results of total IAQ are given by calculating the percentage of at least “Good” among four parameters. Note that the evaluation criteria for (total) IAQ used in this work are more applicable in the studied building as shown in [Fig. 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#fig0002), which is located in Nanjing, China. The criteria can be adapted when intelligent ventilation control system is applied in other countries or regions. It is better to develop reliable values of criteria to improve the performance of intelligent ventilation control, which is discussed in [Section 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#sec0025).\n\nTable 1. Evaluation criteria for total IAQ.\n\n| Empty Cell | PM<sub>2.5</sub> (μg/m<sup>3</sup>) | TVOC (mg/m<sup>3</sup>) | Temperature (°C) | RH (%) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Excellent | ≤ 25 | ≤ 0.3 |  |  |\n| Good | 25–50 | 0.3–0.6 | 24–28 | 40–60 |\n| Poor | \\> 50 | \\> 0.6 |  |  |\n\nAirborne infection risk _R<sub>inf</sub>_ (%) is evaluated by the revisited Wells-Riley equation using $<math><mrow is=\"true\"><mo is=\"true\">〈</mo><mi is=\"true\">C</mi><mo is=\"true\">〉</mo></mrow></math>$ as the airborne pollutant level (instead of the aerosol quantum concentration), as shown in [Eq. (5)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#eqn0005) ([Rudnick & Milton, 2003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0038)). If the quantum generation rate (_r<sub>q</sub>_, h<sup>−1</sup>), breathing rate (_r<sub>b</sub>_, m<sup>3</sup>/h), number of infected people (_N<sub>I</sub>_), and number of people (_N<sub>p</sub>_) remain constant, the average quantum concentration ($<math><mover accent=\"true\" is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">Q</mi><mo is=\"true\">¯</mo></mover></math>$) can be equal to the quantum concentration in the exhaled breath of infected people (_r<sub>q</sub>_/_r<sub>b</sub>_) multiplied by average volume fraction of air exhaled by infected people ($<math><mrow is=\"true\"><mover accent=\"true\" is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">f</mi><mo is=\"true\">¯</mo></mover><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">N</mi><mi is=\"true\">I</mi></msub><mo linebreak=\"goodbreak\" is=\"true\">/</mo><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">N</mi><mi is=\"true\">p</mi></msub></mrow></math>$), i.e., $<math><mrow is=\"true\"><mover accent=\"true\" is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">Q</mi><mo is=\"true\">¯</mo></mover><mo linebreak=\"goodbreak\" is=\"true\">=</mo><mover accent=\"true\" is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">f</mi><mo is=\"true\">¯</mo></mover><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">N</mi><mi is=\"true\">I</mi></msub><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">r</mi><mi is=\"true\">q</mi></msub><mo linebreak=\"goodbreak\" is=\"true\">/</mo><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">N</mi><mi is=\"true\">P</mi></msub><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">r</mi><mi is=\"true\">b</mi></msub><mspace width=\"0.33em\" is=\"true\"></mspace><mrow is=\"true\"><mo is=\"true\">[</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><mover accent=\"true\" is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">f</mi><mo is=\"true\">¯</mo></mover><mo linebreak=\"badbreak\" is=\"true\">=</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><mo is=\"true\">(</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><mrow is=\"true\"><mo is=\"true\">〈</mo><mi is=\"true\">C</mi><mo is=\"true\">〉</mo></mrow><mo linebreak=\"badbreak\" is=\"true\">−</mo><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">C</mi><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">i</mi><mi is=\"true\">n</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><mo is=\"true\">)</mo></mrow><mo linebreak=\"badbreak\" is=\"true\">/</mo><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">C</mi><mi is=\"true\">e</mi></msub></mrow><mo is=\"true\">]</mo></mrow></mrow></math>$.(5)$<math><mrow is=\"true\"><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">R</mi><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">i</mi><mi is=\"true\">n</mi><mi is=\"true\">f</mi></mrow></msub><mo linebreak=\"goodbreak\" is=\"true\">=</mo><mn is=\"true\">1</mn><mo linebreak=\"goodbreak\" is=\"true\">−</mo><mi is=\"true\">e</mi><mi is=\"true\">x</mi><mi is=\"true\">p</mi><mrow is=\"true\"><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">(</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><mo is=\"true\">−</mo><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">r</mi><mi is=\"true\">b</mi></msub><mi is=\"true\">t</mi><mover accent=\"true\" is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">Q</mi><mo is=\"true\">¯</mo></mover></mrow><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">)</mo></mrow><mo linebreak=\"goodbreak\" is=\"true\">=</mo><mn is=\"true\">1</mn><mo linebreak=\"goodbreak\" is=\"true\">−</mo><mi is=\"true\">e</mi><mi is=\"true\">x</mi><mi is=\"true\">p</mi><mrow is=\"true\"><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">(</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><mo is=\"true\">−</mo><mfrac is=\"true\"><mrow is=\"true\"><mover accent=\"true\" is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">f</mi><mo is=\"true\">¯</mo></mover><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">N</mi><mi is=\"true\">I</mi></msub><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">r</mi><mi is=\"true\">q</mi></msub><mi is=\"true\">t</mi></mrow><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">N</mi><mi is=\"true\">P</mi></msub></mfrac></mrow><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></math>$where, _C<sub>in</sub>_ is the inlet CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (ppm); _C<sub>e</sub>_ is the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (ppm) added to exhaled breath, which is defined as 38,000 ppm at low levels of oxygen consumption by people ([Rudnick & Milton, 2003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0038)); and _t_ is the exposure time (h), which is defined as 1 h. Estimated _r<sub>q</sub>_ is set to 48 h<sup>−1</sup> ([Dai & Zhao, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0006)), and _N<sub>I</sub>_ is defined as 1, that is, any person can be the infector. The prevention effect is assessed based on the changing rate of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration before and after the decision (through setting the optimal _V<sub>in</sub>_ after the decision). Epidemic prevention level is assessed based on infection risk: “_R<sub>inf</sub>_ ≤ 1%” for “Excellent”, “1% 〈 _R<sub>inf</sub>_  ≤ 1.5%” for “Good”, and “_R<sub>inf</sub>_ 〉 1.5%” for “Poor” ([Dai & Zhao, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0006)).\n\nCooling load _L<sub>c</sub>_ (kW) is calculated by [Eq. (6)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#eqn0006), including the load by introducing the outdoor air (_L<sub>oa</sub>_, kW), the heat transfer load through the envelope (_L<sub>e</sub>_, kW), and the sensible heat dissipation load emitted by people and equipment (_L<sub>s</sub>_, kW).

Ventilation energy consumption (_EC_, kW) is calculated dividing _L<sub>c</sub>_ with the coefficient of performance (COP). Furthermore, energy efficiency is calculated on account of the ventilation energy consumption before and after the decision.\n\nThe decision of optimal _V<sub>in</sub>_ is to balance IAQ, epidemic prevention, and energy consumption.

During the fast decision, the real-time _V<sub>in</sub>_ from ventilation system, CO<sub>2</sub> concentration data from rapid prediction, and _N<sub>p</sub>_ from computer vision detection are used to calculate the real-time _E<sub>cp</sub>_. Then, the differences between the real-time _E<sub>cp</sub>_ and the samples are calculated to obtain the sample _E<sub>cp-sm</sub>_ with a smallest difference and the corresponding _N<sub>p</sub>_. Finally, with the same condition of _N<sub>p</sub>_, all samples _E<sub>cp</sub>_ are traversed to judge whether _E<sub>cp-sm</sub>_ is the minimum value: if _E<sub>cp-sm</sub>_ is minimum, the real-time _V<sub>in</sub>_ is the optimal one; if _E<sub>cp-sm</sub>_ is not minimum, _V<sub>in</sub>_ corresponding to the smallest _E<sub>cp</sub>_ is the optimal one. Optimal _V<sub>in</sub>_ by fast decision is further used for the control of ventilation system, ref., [Section 2.5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#sec0015).\n\n### 2.4.

The negative ion generators are placed at the height of 0.5 m, and the maximum number of 10 is considered.

Fast decision for air purification system\n\nFast decision for air purification system is applied to improve the removal efficiency of particles. The optimal number of negative ion generators is determined by comparing the removal efficiencies under different layout strategies. Generally, two negative ion generators are turned on, and then the removal efficiency is calculated. If the removal efficiency is below 70% (the threshold assumed in this work) under two negative ion generators, the number should be increased, and the removal efficiency is further reevaluated. Removal efficiency _η_ (%) is calculated by the particle concentrations when negative ion generators are turned on and off.(8)$<math><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">η</mi><mo linebreak=\"goodbreak\" is=\"true\">=</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">[</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><mn is=\"true\">1</mn><mo linebreak=\"badbreak\" is=\"true\">−</mo><mfrac is=\"true\"><mrow is=\"true\"><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">C</mi><mi is=\"true\">p</mi></msub><mspace width=\"0.33em\" is=\"true\"></mspace><mrow is=\"true\"><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">(</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">o</mi><mi is=\"true\">n</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mrow is=\"true\"><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">C</mi><mi is=\"true\">p</mi></msub><mspace width=\"0.33em\" is=\"true\"></mspace><mrow is=\"true\"><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">(</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">o</mi><mi is=\"true\">f</mi><mi is=\"true\">f</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mfrac></mrow><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">]</mo></mrow><mo linebreak=\"goodbreak\" is=\"true\">×</mo><mspace width=\"0.33em\" is=\"true\"></mspace><mn is=\"true\">100</mn><mo is=\"true\">%</mo></mrow></math>$where, _C<sub>p</sub>_ (_on_) is the particle concentration (#/m<sup>3</sup>) when negative ion generators are turned on; and _C<sub>p</sub>_ (_off_) is the particle concentration (#/m<sup>3</sup>) when negative ion generators are turned off. The optimal number of negative ion generators by fast decision is further used to control air purification system.\n\n### 2.5. Operation, maintenance and control system\n\nBy combining limited monitoring modules, rapid prediction models and fast decision methods, the intelligent operation, maintenance, and control system for indoor environment is developed based on five subsystems, as shown in **Appendix C**. Intelligent ventilation system corresponds to subsystems 1, 2, 3 and 4, and air purification system corresponds to subsystem 5.\n\nThe visualization platform of intelligent operation, maintenance, and control system is built based on these subsystems (detailed in [Section 3.6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#sec0024)). Regarding the control units, the optimal _V<sub>in</sub>_ for intelligent ventilation system is regulated by the dampers, which are connected to the controller (PCF8591 driver module) to remotely receive the control commands on _V<sub>in</sub>_. Negative ion generators (the number) are controlled by remote power switch. Negative ion generators are turned on when the monitored PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration exceeds 50 μg/m<sup>3</sup> and the front hall is unoccupied (during 8:00–17:00), to reduce the potential harmful effect of negative ion generator. Then, optimal number of negative ion generators is evaluated by the fast decision for air purification system ([Section 2.4.2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#sec0014)).\n\n[Table 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#tbl0003) shows an overview of cases in this work. 18 cases are used for the FCM cluster analysis and training of the rapid prediction model. One case is utilized for the validation of rapid prediction model. 15 cases are applied to analyze the effect of negative ion generator on the air purification. The cases for grid independence analysis are not shown here.\n\nTable 3.

Results and discussion\n\nFirst, deployment strategies (number and location) of limited sensors were determined and analyzed. Then, simulations’ prediction was compared with the experiment, to validate the simulation model. Rapid prediction models were validated by the simulation. Optimal deployment of sensors was determined. The air purification effects based on negative oxygen ions and particles were analyzed with different numbers of negative ion generators. Optimal _V<sub>in</sub>_ and number of negative ion generators were evaluated, respectively, based on the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, infection risk, and ventilation energy consumption, and the removal efficiencies before and after the decision. The visualization platform was established.\n\n### 3.1. Deployment strategy of limited monitoring sensors\n\nIn this section, the cluster results by the FCM algorithm were analyzed in **Appendix D**. For different numbers of clusters (sensors), the coordinates of cluster centroids with _V<sub>in</sub>_ = 0.7 m/s were selected as the sensor locations. [Fig. 6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#fig0006) displays the deployment strategies for different numbers of sensors. The optimal deployment strategy of sensors was determined comparing prediction errors (with monitoring data from different number of sensors as inputs), as shown in [Section 3.3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#sec0019).\n\n![Fig 6](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2210670723001440-gr6.jpg)\n\n1.

Model validation\n\nThe simulation model's prediction was verified by the experiment, and the grid independence analysis was carried out among three different computational grids, namely coarse (1404,586 cells), medium (5233,965 cells), and fine (9490,272 cells), as shown in [Fig. 7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#fig0007). At the validation line (_X_ = 8.3 m, _Y_ = 11.9 m, and _Z_ = 0–15 m), the velocity profiles between medium and fine grids agreed well, showing that the medium grids were adequately resolved in the simulation cases.\n\n![Fig 7](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2210670723001440-gr7.jpg)\n\n1.

The experiment and simulation showed consistent results on the average velocity. Some differences were noted in average CO<sub>2</sub> concentration as _V<sub>in</sub>_ increased, and the largest difference was 6.8%. In the experiment, people may move in the front hall, which can potentially influence the validation accuracy.\n\n### 3.3. Verification of rapid prediction models using simulation model\n\n#### 3.3.1. Verification of low-dimensional linear model (LLM)\n\nThe recomposition performance of uniform and non-uniform LMs was compared based on sub-layer divisions of 6 × 6 × 6, 9 × 9 × 9, 12 × 12 × 12, and 15 × 15 × 15. [Fig. 8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#fig0008) illustrates the velocity fields and compares the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration fields from CFD simulation, uniform LM, and non-uniform LM under the scenario of _V<sub>in</sub>_ = 0.7 m/s and _N<sub>p</sub>_ = 20. The distribution trends of velocity and concentration were similar. With the increased sub-layer number, recomposition performance of LM was improved, which could better reflect the distribution characteristics of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration field. In this study, the recomposition performance of non-uniform LM was superior to that of uniform LM, especially when the sub-layer divisions were 12 × 12 × 12 and 15 × 15 × 15.\n\n![Fig 8](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2210670723001440-gr8.jpg)\n\n1.

Velocity field and comparison of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration fields among CFD simulation, uniform LM, and non-uniform LM under the scenario of _V<sub>in</sub>_ = 0.7 m/s and _N<sub>p</sub>_ = 20 (Note: 6 × 6 × 6, 9 × 9 × 9, 12 × 12 × 12, and 15 × 15 × 15 represent the initial equal divisions of computational domain by 6, 9, 12, and 15 sub-layers in X, Y, and Z directions; 36, 86, 316, and 348 represent the number of zones after self-adaption of initial sub-layer divisions, which is detailed in [Section 2.3.2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#sec0010)). (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)\n\nThe discretization errors for uniform and non-uniform LMs were calculated, as shown in [Fig. 9](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#fig0009). The discretization error clearly decreased when the number of sub-layers increased. The error index of non-uniform LM outperformed uniform one, indicating its superiority in recomposition accuracy. Moreover, discretization error was analyzed when the sub-layer division was 11 × 11 × 11, which was about 1%−3% higher than 15%. When sub-layer was divided as 12 × 12 × 12, the error of non-uniform LM was below 15%, which can effectively recompose the database.\n\n![Fig 9](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2210670723001440-gr9.jpg)\n\n1.

Low-dimensional discretization error (%) for uniform and non-uniform LMs under different sub-layers. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)\n\n[Fig. 10](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#fig0010) compares the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration fields between non-uniform LLM and CFD simulation under the scenarios of _V<sub>in</sub>_ = 0.7 m/s and _N<sub>p</sub>_ = 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120. The CO<sub>2</sub> concentration had a substantial increasing trend when _N<sub>p</sub>_ increased. The distribution characteristics of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration fields were similar under different scenarios of _N<sub>p</sub>_, because of the same _V<sub>in</sub>_ resulting in similar velocity fields. For different _N<sub>p</sub>_, non-uniform LLM greatly performed in recomposing the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration database when sub-layers were divided as 12 × 12 × 12. In [Table 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#tbl0004), the discretization errors of non-uniform LLM were calculated less than 15% compared with the simulation. Moreover, non-uniform LLM can reduce the construction cost of database by over 90% compared with the simulation (from hundreds of megabytes to hundreds of kilobytes), and improve the efficiency of rapid prediction.\n\n![Fig 10](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2210670723001440-gr10.jpg)\n\n1.

A superscript asterisk marked the monitoring zone where the sensors were located. The increased number of sensors improved the prediction performance. When the number of sensors was 3 or 4, the predicted CO<sub>2</sub> concentration fields from ANN were higher or lower than those obtained from CFD-based LLM. When the number of sensors was above 5, the rapid prediction results almost agreed with CFD results, indicating that five sensors could greatly enhance the rapid prediction efficiency.\n\n![Fig 11](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2210670723001440-gr11.jpg)\n\n1.

The threshold of 10% error was selected to judge whether the prediction performance was acceptable. When the number of sensors was 3, the average prediction error was between 15% and 20%, and the minimum error was larger than 10%. When the number of sensors was 4, the average prediction error was less than 10%, yet the maximum error was about 13%, making the ANN potentially ineffective in predicting the local CO<sub>2</sub> concentration field. As the number of sensors was more than five, the maximum prediction error was constantly below 10%, showing an acceptable prediction accuracy. Thus, the optimal number of sensors was determined as 5.\n\n![Fig 12](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2210670723001440-gr12.jpg)\n\n1.

Furthermore, the concentration was largely reduced by 34% compared with the inlet concentration. When the number was more than 6, the air purification effect was largely improved, and the average concentration was reduced by about 61% compared with the inlet concentration. The increased _V<sub>in</sub>_ could result in increased particle concentrations, since particles were released from the inlets.\n\n![Fig 14](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2210670723001440-gr14.jpg)\n\n1.

(a) _N<sub>p</sub>_ and (b) _V<sub>in</sub>_ before the control and after the control (optimal _V<sub>in</sub>_ after the control) changing over time (from 8:00 to 17:00). (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)\n\n[Fig. 15](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#fig0015)(b) shows the variations of _V<sub>in</sub>_ before and after the decision (control). The _V<sub>in</sub>_ before the control was set as 0.7 m/s during 8:00–10:00 and 15:00–17:00, and 2.3 m/s during 10:30–14:30. The optimal _V<sub>in</sub>_ after the control was rapidly decided by the comprehensive evaluation index _E<sub>cp</sub>_ in [Eq. (7)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#eqn0007). The weightings for sub-indicators of pollutant concentration, infection risk and energy consumption were calculated by analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method ([Saaty, 1980](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#bib0039)), which is detailed in **Appendix E**. The weightings were calculated as 0.31, 0.63, and 0.06 for pollutant concentration, infection risk, and ventilation energy consumption, respectively, and optimal _V<sub>in</sub>_ was obtained by traversing the database of _E<sub>cp</sub>_. Substantial differences were observed in the optimal _V<sub>in</sub>_ for different times. When _N<sub>p</sub>_ changed unpredictably, the fast decision of intelligent ventilation system can rapidly respond to the optimal _V<sub>in</sub>_, based on the online monitoring data of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration and velocity.\n\n[Fig. 16](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#fig0016) illustrates the online monitoring data of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration and velocity changing over time before (basic scenario) and after the control based on optimal layouts of sensors. When _V<sub>in</sub>_ was 0.7 m/s before the control, the monitored CO<sub>2</sub> concentration increased to above 1000 ppm, indicating the deterioration of IAQ. As _V<sub>in</sub>_ increased from 0.7 to 2.3 m/s, indoor air velocity increased about two times and CO<sub>2</sub> concentration decreased below 1000 ppm, indicating the improvement of IAQ. After the control, CO<sub>2</sub> concentration was consistently below 1000 ppm, and air velocity was below 0.3 m/s. Compared with the basic scenario before the control, fluctuations of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration and velocity were smaller after the control. The average CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the breathing zone before and after the control were rapidly predicted by inputting the monitored CO<sub>2</sub> concentration and velocity.\n\n![Fig 16](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2210670723001440-gr16.jpg)\n\n1.

The increased rate (%) of average CO<sub>2</sub> concentration changing over time was presented as well. During 8:00–10:00 and 15:00–17:00 with _V<sub>in</sub>_ of 0.7 m/s, the average CO<sub>2</sub> concentration before the control was mostly above 1000 ppm, and increased by 45% when compared with that after the control. During 10:30–14:30 with _V<sub>in</sub>_ of 2.3 m/s, the average concentration before the control was almost less than 1000 ppm and reduced by around 50% compared with that after the control. Generally, the average CO<sub>2</sub> concentration after the control based on optimal _V<sub>in</sub>_ was constantly less than 1000 ppm to satisfy the requirement of good IAQ, which proved the effectiveness of fast decision of optimal _V<sub>in</sub>_ in intelligent ventilation.\n\n![Fig 17](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2210670723001440-gr17.jpg)\n\n1.

[Fig. 18](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#fig0018)(a) shows the variation of infection risk over time before (basic scenario) and after the control. For the scenario of before the control, when _V<sub>in</sub>_ was lower, infection risk was higher than 1.5% limitation, indicating the poor epidemic prevention level. After the control, infection risk was constantly less than 1.5%, satisfying the requirement of good epidemic prevention. The variation of ventilation energy consumption over time before and after the control is presented in [Fig. 18](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#fig0018)(b). The ventilation energy consumption after the control largely decreased by 27.4% compared with that before the control. With the increased _V<sub>in</sub>_ after the control (compared with 0.7 m/s before the control), the energy consumption after the control was increased by about 25% when compared with that before the control, at the time moment of 9:30. Increased energy consumption was mainly utilized to reduce the pollutant concentration and control the infection risk, shown in [Figs. 17](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#fig0017) and [18](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#fig0018)(a). Therefore, the fast decision of intelligent ventilation could contribute to the favorable control effects.\n\n![Fig 18](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2210670723001440-gr18.jpg)\n\n1.

When negative ion generators were turned off, the particle concentration was assumed 11,000 #/cm<sup>3</sup>. Removal efficiency increased gradually with an increased number of negative ion generator. When the number was 2, the removal efficiency was the lowest by approaching to about 20%. When the number was ≥ 8, the maximum removal efficiency was 81.2%. Removal efficiency was reduced when _V<sub>in</sub>_ decreased. The limitation of 70% removal efficiency was assumed to determine the optimal number of negative ion generators. Thus, the optimal number was 6 when _V<sub>in</sub>_ was 0.7 m/s, and the optimal number was 8 when _V<sub>in</sub>_ was 1.5 and 2.3 m/s.\n\n![Fig 19](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2210670723001440-gr19.jpg)\n\n1.

Platform of intelligent operation, maintenance, and control for indoor environment\n\nThe visualization platform for intelligent operation, maintenance, and control system is shown in [Fig. 20](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#fig0020). The left column exhibited the control effect of intelligent ventilation, including energy efficiency, rapid prediction of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, and control effect of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. Regarding the column of energy efficiency, real-time ventilation load, ventilation rate, opening degree of damper, and energy saving rate were displayed. Non-uniform low-dimensional linear model (LLM)-based artificial neural network (ANN) can obtain the rapidly predicted CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations with limited monitoring data as inputs. For the control effect of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, average CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the breathing region (based on rapid prediction model), _N<sub>p</sub>_ (based on occupant detection), and IAQ (based on average CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the breathing area) were presented, respectively.\n\n![Fig 20](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2210670723001440-gr20.jpg)\n\n1.

Visualization platform of intelligent operation, maintenance and control for indoor environment in the front hall of the International Convention and Exhibition Center. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)\n\nThe right column displayed the epidemic prevention and removal effect, consisting of effect of epidemic prevention, distribution of removal efficiency, and total removal effect and total IAQ. The effect of epidemic prevention included prevention effect, infection risk, and epidemic prevention level. The distribution removal efficiency was displayed based on the distribution of negative oxygen ions and particles at the breathing plane of _Z_ = 1.7 m. The real-time monitored PM<sub>2.5</sub>, negative oxygen ion (the average value at the breathing plane), TVOC, temperature, and RH were shown in the column of total removal effect and total IAQ.\n\nThe middle column illustrated the fast decision results for removal efficiency, energy efficiency, epidemic prevention level, and IAQ, to emphasize the coupling performance of intelligent ventilation and air purification. Although the increased ventilation rate can lead to the decreased negative oxygen ion concentration, the increased number of air purification device also improved the pollutant removal effect. Generally, negative ion generators potentially reduce the pollutant concentration and infection risk combined with intelligent ventilation. In-depth coupling of intelligent ventilation and purification systems can be further considered in future work, to enhance the performance of intelligent operation, maintenance, and control of building environment. Moreover, the energy consumption of 10 negative ion generators was approximately 50 W, which was negligible compared with the ventilation energy consumption in summer conditions.\n\n## 4\\. Conclusions\n\nWith respect to the non-uniform distributions of public building environment, this study develops an intelligent operation, maintenance, and control system in the front hall of the International Convention and Exhibition Center, by coupling intelligent ventilation and air purification systems. The pollutant concentration fields are rapidly predicted using non-uniform low-dimensional linear model (LLM)-based artificial neural network (ANN) model, based on optimal deployment strategy of limited sensors. Optimal inlet velocity (_V<sub>in</sub>_) and number of negative ion generators are evaluated, respectively, through fast decision of ventilation and air purification performance. Ventilation and air purification systems are controlled in real time based on the evaluation results. Finally, a visualization platform of intelligent operation, maintenance, and control system is established to effectively display the effects for online monitoring, rapid prediction, fast decision, and dynamic control. The main conclusions are as follows.\n\n-   (1)\n    \n    Taking limited monitoring data from the optimal deployment of sensors (number of 5) as inputs, the prediction error of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration field by ANN model based on non-uniform LLM (sub-layer number of 12) was less than 10% compared with CFD simulation.\n    \n-   (2)\n    \n    Fast decision of intelligent ventilation can rapidly respond to the optimal _V<sub>in</sub>_, which largely improved the ventilation performance by reducing CO<sub>2</sub> concentration below 1000 ppm, infection risk below 1.5%, and ventilation energy consumption by 27.4%.\n    \n-   (3)\n    \n    Using the air purification system, the average particle concentration was largely reduced by 61% compared with the inlet concentration. By fast decision for air purification system, the maximum removal efficiency was 81.2% when the number of negative ion generators was 10.\n    \n-   (4)\n    \n    By establishing a visualization platform, the intelligent operation, maintenance, and control system showed the control effects of intelligent ventilation, epidemic prevention, pollutant removal, and energy savings efficiently, through coupling the intelligent ventilation and air purification systems.\n    \n\nThe limitations and future work are discussed. (i) This study develops the intelligent operation, maintenance, and control system (platform) of indoor environment in a front hall. However, the full-scale system for public building is not developed, and also the effects of intelligent ventilation control system are not verified by the experimental data, which should be the focus of future work. (ii) The coupling analysis between intelligent ventilation and air purification systems is considered, while the future work should also integrate the ventilation rate, infection risk, energy efficiency, removal effect, and IAQ deeply. Particularly, the mutual positive and negative influences between ventilation and air purification systems should be considered. (iii) There are still uncertainties about evaluation criteria of IAQ for intelligent ventilation control system, especially when applied in different countries or regions due to the potential limitations of different standards or recommendations. It can be favorable to establish the reliable values of criteria to improve the performance of intelligent ventilation control, which will be studied in future work. (iv) The real-time monitoring of occupant location and behavior should be also considered in the intelligent operation, maintenance, and control system to improve the prediction and control performance of dynamic building environment. (v) The intelligent operation, maintenance, and control system (platform) should be applied to more types of public buildings (e.g., hospitals, offices, and schools), and the diversification of indoor environmental parameters (including different pollutant types) should be also considered, in order to improve the integrated performance of operation, maintenance, and control.\n\n## Declaration of Competing Interest\n\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the supports from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. [52178069](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#gs00001)), and the National Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholar (Grant No. 52225005), and the Funds for International Cooperation and Exchange of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. [52211530036](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723001440#gs00002)).\n\n## Data availability\n\n-   Data will be made available on request.\n    \n\n## References\n\n1.

A novel approach to system reliability analysis using DFTA, FMECA and BBN applied to 4 DGs has been conducted. The outcomes provide insight on faults and component [criticality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/criticality \"Learn more about criticality from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") to vessel maintenance and availability. Building from the understanding of how multiple factors can influenced maintenance in addition to routine or age-related wear and tear of machinery. This research looked into operators’ peculiar challenges regarding environment, operational demands and [technology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/science-and-technology \"Learn more about technology from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") challenges that affects maintenance and system reliability. A framework based on outputs from DFTA [minimal cut set](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/minimal-cut-set \"Learn more about minimal cut set from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), RPN from FMECA were used as inputs for BBN to analyse ship marine DG system availability. A BBN influence diagram was used to build a maintenance strategy DSS. Overall outcome for the maintenance strategy selection DSS indicates relatively high unavailability. Therefore, DGs with low availability were recommended to be on Corrective action and ConMon, while DGs with good availability were recommended to be on PMS.\n\n-   [Previous](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001257)\n-   [Next](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001774)\n\n## Keywords\n\nSystem reliability\n\nMaintenance\n\nDynamic fault tree analysis\n\nBayesian belief network\n\nDecision support system\n\nMission critical component\n\nMarine systems\n\n## Nomenclature\n\nABS(NS)\n\nAmerican Bureau of Shipping (Nautical System)\n\nBBN\n\nBayesian Belief Network\n\nBE\n\nBasic Event\n\nBSI\n\n[British Standards Institution](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/british-standard-institution \"Learn more about British Standards Institution from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\")\n\nCBM\n\nCondition Based Maintenance\n\nCMMS\n\nComputerised Maintenance Management System\n\nCPT\n\nConditional Probability Table\n\nDFTA\n\nDynamic Fault Tree\n\nDG\n\nDiesel Generator\n\nDNV\n\nDet Norske Veritas\n\nDSS\n\nDecision Support System\n\nEMS\n\nEnterprise Management System\n\nETA\n\nEvent Tree Analysis\n\nFDEP\n\nFunctional Dependency\n\nFMEA\n\n[Failure Mode and Effect Analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/failure-mode-and-effect-analysis \"Learn more about Failure Mode and Effect Analysis from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\")\n\nFMECA\n\nFailure Mode Effect and Criticality Analysis\n\nFTA\n\nFault Tree Analysis\n\nIM\n\nImportance Measure\n\nIMO\n\n[International Maritime Organisation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/international-maritime-organisation \"Learn more about International Maritime Organisation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\")\n\nISM code\n\nInternational Safety Management\n\nLED\n\nLight-emitting diode\n\nMCS\n\nMinimal Cut Set\n\nMDT\n\nMean Down Time\n\nMRO\n\nMaintenance Repair and Overhaul\n\nMTTF\n\nMean Time to Failure\n\nNASA\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nNPRD\n\nNon-Electronic Reliability Data\n\nNSWC\n\nNaval Surface [Warfare](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/warfare \"Learn more about Warfare from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") Centre\n\nNUREG\n\nNuclear Regulatory Report\n\nOEM\n\nOriginal Equipment Manufacturer\n\nOPV\n\nOffshore Patrol Vessel\n\nOREDA\n\noffshore and Onshore Reliability Data\n\nPAND\n\nPriority- AND\n\nPMS\n\nPlanned Maintenance System\n\nRCM\n\nReliability Centred Maintenance\n\nSEQ\n\nSequence Enforcing\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nThe foundation of system reliability rests on two primary pillars, the first of which is intrinsic to the system's architecture and the second is obtained via maintenance strategy and execution. The capacity of the operator to effectively follow the maintenance plan set by an organisation helps to reduce failure and maintain the system's excellent operating condition between maintenance intervals. In this respect, the maintenance department's objective will be to use all available strategies to guarantee that failures are not only minimised, but also handled in an efficient and timely way. This might imply efficient maintenance, such as utilising the proper [lubricants](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/lubricating-oil \"Learn more about lubricants from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), changing filters when due or depending on their condition, and ensuring that spare parts inventory reflects component failure and replacement rate. Moreover, the International Safety Management (ISM) code provides guidance to all ship operators, and the document underlined the necessity for companies and ship operators to develop additional requirements to assist effective ship system maintenance ([IACS,2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib70)). In addition, it requires ship operators to identify equipment and technical systems whose sudden failure might lead to dangerous circumstances (IMO, 2018).\n\nThe existing maintenance strategy namely Corrective, Predictive, Preventive and Condition based maintenance are often selectively combined using reliability analysis procedures to come up with other hybrid maintenance strategies([Lazakis et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib43)). In particular, the wide application of Planned Maintenance System (PMS) and Reliability Centred Maintenance (RCM) in the industry can be attributed to adaptation of more than one maintenance approach to provide maintenance for entire systems ([Karatuğ and Arslanoğlu, 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib38)). In general maintenance guidelines for machinery and equipment forming a system are obtained from the [Original Equipment Manufacturers](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/original-equipment-manufacturer \"Learn more about Original Equipment Manufacturers from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") (OEM) Manual. Similarly, alternative elaborate maintenance procedures are equally provided by Classification societies through guidance notes which provides relevant options and information to operators who desire such services (ABS, 2016; IACS, 2021). Moreover, maintenance management systems such as Computerised Maintenance Management System (CMMS) that are stand-alone or come as a part of Enterprise Management System (EMS) are also provided by Classification Societies, Asset management companies, or the maintenance division of the organisation([Eriksen et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib27)). For instance, American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) and DNV-GL provides leading edge maintenance management system such as NS maintenance management and ship manager software respectively(ABS, 2016).\n\nOverall, there are multiple channels which ship operators can access [operation and maintenance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/operation-and-maintenance \"Learn more about operation and maintenance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") support except that most of this support being enterprise and generic in nature may not be as dynamic and responsive as the operator would want. Hence the need for researchers to provides solutions to both regulators and operators. Maintenance as defined by ([BS, 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib10)) is the combination of all technical, administrative and managerial actions during the life cycle of an item intended to retain it in, or restore it to, a state in which it can perform the required function. Therefore, by emphasising key phrases in the definition, \"retain\" and \"restore\"; refer to maintenance activities, while \"perform\" and \"function\" refer to the utility needed from the system or equipment. It follows that all maintenance procedures would be designed to guarantee that a system is available at all times within acceptable reliability limits. These limits are defined by factors which largely depends on the reliability inherent to the equipment and its usage. Other factors are to do with operators' environment, maintenance staff competencies, spare parts sourcing and maintenance strategy employed. In this regard the OREDA handbook provides a good reference on multiple equipment reliability analysis approach with acceptable generalisation regarding operating environment and equipment specific reliabilities ([Lazakis et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib43); [Marving Rausand and Arnljot, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib47)).\n\nIn this regard this paper will present the development of an advanced reliability analysis framework for marine systems operations and maintenance through application of reliability analysis tools for identifying maintenance critical components. The methodology also provides a maintenance decision support system for maintenance critical components on board ships. Considering this, the work is organised into parts, with Section [2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#sec2) providing a critical evaluation of system reliability analysis tools, Section [3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#sec3) presenting the innovative approach of this research, and Section [4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#sec4) discussing the case study application of the technique. Section [5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#sec5) presents Results and Discussion, while Section [6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#sec6) presents Conclusions and Recommendations for Future Research.\n\n## 2\\. Critical review on system reliability analysis\n\nSystem reliability analysis is central to the successful implementation of any maintenance strategy as it provides clear insight on machinery behaviour and the impacts of failure on availability of machineries up to system levels ([Ahn et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib2); [Bahoo et al., 2022a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib5); [Daya and Lazakis, 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib21)). Accordingly, reliability analysis tools are widely used to support maintenance strategy selection or implementation in line with organisational objectives. Therefore, various maintenance strategy such as Reliability Centred Maintenance, Risk based Maintenance, Total Productive Maintenance, Risk and Reliability Based Maintenance etc draw from existing maintenance approach using system reliability analysis to provide a tailored maintenance system([Cheliotis et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib13)). RCM developed in the aviation industry and [United States Navy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/united-states-navy \"Learn more about United States Navy from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") in the 1970s ([NAVSEA, 2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib51)) provides clear intersection on the combination of various maintenance strategy and used of reliability tools. For instance, the guidelines for the development and implementation of RCM by the Royal Navy and United States Navy considered the role of PMS and CBM as a requirement for achieving any RCM program(MoD, 2007; [NAVSEA, 2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib51)). While the nature of PMS stipulates time-based approach, that of CBM relies on sensor deployments hence the place of system reliability analysis to harness the weakness in both([Cicek and Celik, 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib16); [Cipollini et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib17); [Velasco-Gallego and Lazakis, 2022a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib65)). In general reliability analysis tools examine the effects and risk of failure by considering quantitative and qualitative aspects of machinery [maintenance and operations](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/operation-and-maintenance \"Learn more about maintenance and operations from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") data ([Karatuğ and Arslanoğlu, 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib38)).\n\nTo this end, various researchers have implemented the use of tools such as [FTA](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/fault-tree-analysis \"Learn more about FTA from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), ETA and RBD mostly combined to provide maintenance analysis approach in order to overcome issues such as [discretisation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/discretization \"Learn more about discretisation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), linguistic restriction, and expert judgment ([Duan and Zhou, 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib25); [Jun and Kim, 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib34); [Kampitsis and Panagiotidou, 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib37); [Khakzad et al., 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib39)). Research efforts by ([Konstantinos Dikis et al., 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib40); [Lazakis and Ölçer, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib41); [Lazakis et al., 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib42); [Velasco-Gallego and Lazakis, 2022a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib65)) implemented a risk and [reliability assessment methods](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/reliability-assessment-method \"Learn more about reliability assessment methods from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of FMECA and FTA as well as using Fuzzy [Multi Criteria Decision Making](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/multi-criteria-decision-making \"Learn more about Multi Criteria Decision Making from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") Approach (FCDMA) in order to identify critical components and provide maintenance decision support for ships with focus on equipment risk and [criticality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/criticality \"Learn more about criticality from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") to maintenance. Other tools such as Bayesian belief networks, Monte Carlo simulation, [Markov chains](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/markov-chain \"Learn more about Markov chains from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), [Petri Nets](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/petri-net \"Learn more about Petri Nets from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and Weibull analysis among others have been applied to model maintenance planning ([Kabir and Papadopoulos, 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib36); [Leimeister and Kolios, 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib44); [Melani et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib48)). On the other hand, complex system reliability analysis requiring inputs that are largely non-binary and continuous with stochastic failure behaviour would require different approach to address temporal system state or a repairable [mechanical system](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/mechanical-systems \"Learn more about mechanical system from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") that can operate satisfactorily at degraded condition. Recent research efforts have also focused on ship machinery real-time [anomaly detection](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/anomaly-detection \"Learn more about anomaly detection from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") for fault diagnosis ([Velasco-Gallego and Lazakis, 2022a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib65)); application of Bayesian and machine learning-based fault detection and diagnostics (Cheliotis et all, 2022); real-time data-driven missing data imputation evaluation for short-term sensor data of marine systems ([Velasco-Gallego and Lazakis, 2022a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib65)); and the development of a time series imaging approach for fault classification ([Velasco-Gallego and Lazakis, 2022b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib66)). Therefore, additional flexibility to produce a representative model taking all possible consideration will be required. Consequently, researchers have resorted to the use of multiple tools to accommodate system dependencies and complexities of multi system ([Marving Rausand and Arnljot, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib47); [Piadeh et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib54); [Velasco-Gallego and Lazakis, 2022a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib65), [2022b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib66)). This strategy enables the use of multiple data types for reliability analysis and the use of tools in a more flexible manner([Leimeister and Kolios, 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib44)). Accordingly, a critical review highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of the reliability tools used for this research will discussed.\n\n### 2.1. Fault tree analysis\n\nFault tree analysis (FTA) is a static method for analysing component faults in systems or equipment by identifying all possible causes of likely failures and impacts on the system through the logical analysis of dependencies in the basic events that lead to the undesired event, the top event of the fault tree([Lazakis et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib43){[NASA, 2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib49) #136)}. FTA is an important tool for reliability and risk analysis as it provides critical information used to prioritise the importance of the contributors to the undesired events([Relex et al., 2003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib55)). It utilises Boolean law by applying gates and events to describe faulty components and possible event(s) that could develop a fault. Therefore, FTA is an important tool for reliability and risk analysis as it provides critical information used to prioritise the importance of the contributors to the undesired event i.e fault or failure. However, it has some shortcomings to do with sequence dependencies, temporal order of occurrence and redundancies due to standby systems, consequently DFTA was developed to overcome these constraints in the static FT.\n\nThe dynamic gates which include Priority and gate (PAND), Sequence Enforcing gate (SEQ), Functional Dependency gate (FDEP), Spare gate (SPARE) and the spare event when added to the FTA structure becomes Dynamic FTA ([NASA, 2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib49)). In the PAND gate events are prioritised from left to right such that the left most event (fault) is considered first before the next; similarly, SEQ considers events in left to right fashion however rather than prioritising it enforces hence ensuring that events follow the expected failure mechanism([Kabir, 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib35)). On the other hand, the FDEP though evaluate events from left to right it does that considering the occurrence of primary, or causal event which is independent of other faults to the right([Kabir, 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib35)). The SPARE gate and event have unique attributes and functions; though events are evaluated from left to right as obtained in other gates, the dormancy factor feature of the spare event makes lot of difference. The dormancy factor is a measure of the ratio between failure and operational rate of the spare event in the standby mode ([NASA, 2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib49)). A cold spare has dormancy factor 0, a hot spare has dormancy factor 1 and a warm spare has a dormancy factor between 0 and 1([Relex et al., 2003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib55)). The application of dynamic gates and use of spare gates to analysis improvements in maintenance approach was presented in ([Lazakis et al., 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib42); [Kabir, 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib35) #437) both authors demonstrated how these dynamic gates can be applied to model time and sequence dependent failures.\n\nIn this regard, the dynamic gates in combination with other static gates provide a much robust yet simple structure compared to tools like Markov Chains and RBD. Therefore, DFTA is suitable for modelling complex systems failure behaviour with respect to sequence and dependencies, particularly where the temporal order of the occurrence of events is important to analysis([Chiacchio et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib15); [Jakkula et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib32); [NASA, 2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib49)). This is particularly important in order to account for the failure dynamics of static and dynamic system, while not disregarding the impact of environmental elements, temperature and other factors. The reliability of mechanical systems does not follow [constant failure rate](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/constant-failure-rate \"Learn more about constant failure rate from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") as obtained in [electrical systems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/electrical-system \"Learn more about electrical systems from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") such as semiconductor, LED and software([Relex et al., 2003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib55)). Reliability data bases for mechanical components such as OREDA, NUREG, NSWC, NPRD provide high quality failure rate information on various components and procedures for conducting reliability predictions ([Marving Rausand and Arnljot, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib47)). However, component failure rates for repairable mechanical systems are influenced by multiple factors and may not follow constant failure rates of generic distribution such as Weibull, Normal, [Lognormal](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/lognormal \"Learn more about Lognormal from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") the likes ([Anantharaman et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib3); [Scheu et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib59)). Hence, DFTA provides a platform that is capable for analysing reparable system while considering other factors such as dependencies and temporal behaviour or partially operating state analysis([Marko Cerpin, 2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib46); [Zhou et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib68)). Therefore, this makes it very relevant in analysing system improvements as presented in ([Daya A.A 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib20); [Turan et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib64)). Overall, these additional gates provided more scope in [DFT](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/density-functional-theory \"Learn more about DFT from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") analysis ([Kabir, 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib35); [Ruijters and Stoelinga, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib56)) which can be used to factor repair or improvements due to routine maintenance. Moreover, additional outputs such as reliability importance measures and [minimal cuts sets](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/minimal-cut-set \"Learn more about minimal cuts sets from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") in the DFTA are equally influenced by the logic structure of the model, meaning that the output of static FT and a dynamic FT analysis will be significantly different and reflective of the whatever dependencies exist in the model.\n\nThe DFTA provides additional outputs which are the reliability importance measures (IM) and minimal cut set. The IM provide a means to identify the most critical component/situation that contributes to the occurrence of the low/basic event leading up to equipment failure or top event occurrence ([Chen et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib14); [Kuzu and Senol, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib73) #768)}. Therefore assisting in identifying the event that, if improved, is most likely to produce significant improvement in equipment or system performance ([Relex et al., 2003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib55)). In retrospect the MCS provide insights on failure or fault development, in that MCS are the smallest set of basic events, which if they all occur will result in the top event occurring ([NASA, 2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib49)). Therefore, improving the MCS can greatly improve overall system reliability.\n\nSimilarly, the IM could provide vital information on components to the maintenance crew and ship owners prioritization of actions that could ensure equipment/system reliability through holding of right spares onboard or additional maintenance options. The main IM approaches are Birnbaum (Bir), Fussell-Vesely(F-V) and Criticality (Cri)([Lazakis et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib43)). The Bir IM evaluates the occurrence of the top events based on the probability of its occurring or not occurring, hence the higher the probability the higher the chances of top event occurring([Relex et al., 2003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib55)). Criticality (Cri) IM is calculated in a similar way to Bir IM except that it considers the probability in the occurrence of the basic event to the occurrences of the top event. The F-V calculation adopts an entirely different approach in that; it uses the minimal cut set summation i.e., the minimum number of basic events that contribute to the top event. Therefore, the F-V consider the contribution of the basic event to occurrence of the top event irrespective of how it contributes to the failure.\n\nMaintenance planning for complex system is dynamic and therefore constantly changing, the more reason why organisation adopts different maintenance strategy that could fit the [operational requirement](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/operational-requirement \"Learn more about operational requirement from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") or machinery condition ([Soliman, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib61){Heinz P. Bloch, 2006 #9)}. In this regard DFTA though a robust tool is not able to adequately address issues such as CCF, human error, natural events including subjective factors such as maintenance delays, spare part quality and skills shortages. Accordingly, to overcome some of these factors, DFTA has equally been combined with other tools to achieve additional research goals such as decision support or analysis requiring some level of subjective inputs ([Codetta-Raiteri and Portinale, 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib19); [Zhou et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib68)). Accordingly, DFTA is combine with other tools to improve quality and coverage of analysis such as machine learning based tools for diagnostics and prognosis analysis([Cheliotis et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib13); [Eriksen et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib27)) DFTA, FMECA and other tools([Daya A.A 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib20); [Karatuğ and Arslanoğlu, 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib38)). On the other hand, the constraints imposed by the DFTA structure and the deterministic nature of the input as well as the output makes it restrictive to model certain machinery failures. Overcoming this challenge in this research was done through the use of FMECA, as it provides the required robust framework to holistically analyse failures with all the dynamics involved.\n\n### 2.2. Failure mode effect and criticality analysis\n\nFailure Mode Effect and Criticality Analysis is an evaluation technique to determine the impact of failure or malfunction of system, equipment or components failures by evaluating and prioritising the effect of individual failures ([Daya and Lazakis, 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib21); [NASA, 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib50)). FMECA is composed of 2 analyses, FMEA and Criticality Analysis (CA)([Fu et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib28)). The FMEA is focused on how equipment and system have failed or may fail to perform their function and the effects of these failures, to identify any required corrective actions for implementation to eliminate or minimize the likelihood of severity of failure. While criticality analysis is done to enable prioritization of the failure modes for potential corrective action([Astrom, 2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib4); [Ceylan et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib12)). FMECA is a widely used tool for reliability, criticality and risk analysis across industry and academia, as it does not require much technical knowledge but provides good insight into system failures or malfunction ([DoD, 1989](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib23); [Marving Rausand and Arnljot, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib47)). [Cicek and Celik (2013)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib16) presented an approach for identifying and controlling potential failure or operational errors that trigger [crankcase](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/crankcases \"Learn more about crankcase from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") explosion using FMECA. In ([Lazakis et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib43)) FMEA was used for defect analysis on ship main propulsion engine by identifying critical engine failures for maintenance decision making. FMEA can equally be modified for specific application as presented in ([Niculita et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib52); [Shafiee et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib60)) where a modified Ageing Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (AFMEA) and Functional Failure Mode Effects and Criticality Analysis (FFMECA) was done for the techno-economic life extension analysis of [offshore structure](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/offshore-structure \"Learn more about offshore structure from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and ship systems respectively.\n\nFMECA is a major component used for system analysis of important maintenance concepts such as RCM and PMS as it presents a clear view of equipment, component and personnel interaction and how risk and reliability issues can be mitigated. Mechanical system component failure analysis with FMECA is generally robust particularly in establishing modes of failure and efforts to mitigate or prevent them, however is not practically possible to determine the probability of occurrence for each identified failure rate ([NSWC, 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib53)). In this regard, is common to see FMECA being used alongside other tools for system reliability study ([DoD, 2005](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib24); [Melani et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib48)). This is more so, as the analysis depends on qualitative inputs that can be influenced by the experience or sentiments of respondents, hence subjective([Lazakis and Ölçer, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib41)). Overall, the limitation due to the subjectivity and interpretation of results can be addressed by ranking; using weights, fuzzy methods or hierarchical approach such AHP ([Lazakis and Ölçer, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib41); [Saaty, 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib57)). Accordingly, this paper has adopted the use of FMECA for system reliability analysis in order to account for expert knowledge in failure and mission critical component analysis. FMECA also help capture some subjective operator sentiments which could agree or disagree with reliability results obtained from objective methodologies such as FTA([Marving Rausand and Arnljot, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib47); [NASA, 2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib49)). Accordingly, to address the challenge of interpretation and subjectivity in FMECA analysis a weighting method was introduced to account for experience and years in service of all respondents([Ceylan et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib12)). In doing these, issues of under scoring or over scoring certain failures due to inexperience or narrow judgement can be addressed, hence providing a balanced failure analysis.\n\n### 2.3. Bayesian belief networks\n\nBayesian Belief Networks (BBN) provides a good platform for [dependability](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/dependability \"Learn more about dependability from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") analysis, cause, effect and inferential analysis in a wide range of sectors covering health care, human reliability, machinery system reliability and decision support system ([Ahn et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib2); [BayesFusion, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib7); P. [Weber et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib67)). BBN are represented as direct acyclic graph (DAG) which consist of chance nodes (variables) representing possible outcomes of system states and a given set of arrows (connections) indicating dependability/relationships([Bahoo et al., 2022b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib6); [BayesFusion, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib7); [Canbulat et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib11)). The nodes takes variable inputs in [BBN analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/electric-network-analysis \"Learn more about BBN analysis from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") which can be continues or discreet and are not restricted to single top event, hence providing great flexibility unlike fault tress or RBD([Kabir and Papadopoulos, 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib36)). BBN can be used to represent cause and effect between parts of system or equipment by identifying potential causes of failure. Authors have used BBN for fault and diagnostic analysis as well decision support system (DSS), for instance [Jun and Kim (2017)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib34) presented a Bayesian based fault identification system for CBM by discretising continues parameters based on [maximum likelihood estimation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/maximum-likelihood-estimation \"Learn more about maximum likelihood estimation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") (MLE) to identify failure conditions; the research used the discretised feature as [binary inputs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/binary-input \"Learn more about binary inputs from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") for the BBN [conditional probability](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/conditional-probability \"Learn more about conditional probability from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") table (CPT). Similarly to address port energy efficiency towards the reduction ships emission during port calls a strategy using BBNs was presented in ([Canbulat et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib11)). This research also provides how BBN conditional probability can efficiently in-cooperate expert knowledge to provide vital inputs in decision making variables in areas where there is in adequate data or literature.\n\n[Bayesian updating](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/bayesian-updating \"Learn more about Bayesian updating from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") or inference provides bases for the use of influence diagrams in decisions analysis by computing the impact of new evidence to the probability of events and the influence on all related nodes([BayesFusion, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib7)). As such BN provide a good platform for DSS especially in maintenance strategy selection when considering several dependent and independent factors. Conducting system reliability and maintenance analysis demands in puts from multiple sources which the BN platform can accommodate as compared to other tools. Papers by [Jun and Kim (2017)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib34) and [Li et al. (2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib45) provide methodologies for the use of BBN in reliability analysis, however, while ([Jun and Kim, 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib34)) focused on fault diagnose ([Li et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib45)) emphases on [component reliability](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/component-reliability \"Learn more about component reliability from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") with limited analysis on factors affecting the reliability. Furthermore, BBN have been used to provide inferential analysis in conjunction with other tools such as Markov chain and Petri-nets especially in risk and reliability analysis ([Galagedarage Don and Khan, 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib30); [Kabir and Papadopoulos, 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib36); [Kampitsis and Panagiotidou, 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib37); [Khakzad et al., 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib39)). BBN based DSS are widely applied in maritime industry to handle operational issues such as [human factors](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/ergonomics \"Learn more about human factors from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and procedural issues such as maintenance ([Ahn and Kurt, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib1); [Kampitsis and Panagiotidou, 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib37)). Similarly in the field of ship system reliability analysis ([Velasco-Gallego and Lazakis, 2022b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib66))has presented on the use of BBN and FTA for ship machinery cooling system reliability analysis and DSS. Likewise, Bahoo et al. ([Bahoo et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib5)) applied a combination BBN and [Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/markov-chain-monte-carlo-simulation \"Learn more about Monte Carlo simulation Markov chains from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") to analyses machinery reliability estimation onboard autonomous ships to help maintenance planning and decision.\n\nMaintenance planning and decision marking for ship systems can be complex due to the operational nature, space constraint and onboard environment. Hence maintenance as well as spare parts holding must be carefully considered so that failures and repairs are adequately prioritised to avoid problems with onboard spare parts holding and technical skills mix. Therefore, notwithstanding the rigorous efforts by authors in the field of ship system reliability there exist some important gaps in the literature. Some of this includes, not clearly identifying component criticality to system availability, maintenance action prioritization to reflect failure severity as regard vessel operational demands and selecting maintenance decision to reflect operator's sentiment. Providing solution to these problems require a systematic approach to system reliability analysis. Accordingly, this paper presents a novel methodology, which involves the combination DFTA, FMECA and BBN reliability analysis tools to conduct component criticality analysis, system failure dependency and influence as well as decision support system.\n\nThe presented methodology provides a detailed and comprehensive analysis that identifies critical components in relation to ship availability and maintenance effort in an inclusive manner that can account for operator concerns, OEMs’ recommendations, and environmental influence. Unlike data driven approaches which rely on machinery health parameters or statistical methods such as distribution, [residual life](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/residual-life \"Learn more about residual life from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") estimation through [Mean Time To Failure](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/mean-time-to-failure \"Learn more about Mean Time To Failure from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") (MTTF) which depend on failure rates, hence are unable to provide detailed information on failure and their causes. Other graphical approaches such as the [bathtub curve](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/bathtub-curve \"Learn more about bathtub curve from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") also relies on [failure rate data](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/failure-rate-data \"Learn more about failure rate data from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), which is insufficient to identify issues such as single point failure, [common cause failures](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/common-cause-failure \"Learn more about common cause failures from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") or critical components within a system and its components. Moreover, machinery failures can occur due to material or design defects, age/wear out and poor maintenance or intrusively actual maintenance action. Therefore, a hybrid approach taking into account the multiple dynamics in system reliability and failure mechanics needs to be developed. Accordingly, to develop a ship reliability analysis alongside a maintenance decision support system these selected tools provide a good match and can accommodate all the relevant variables as compared to using one or a couple of these tools. Consequently, FMECA provides outputs for mission critical components based on operator perspective, MCS provides an objective output to reflect MRO data both of which were used to build DSS using BBN. Furthermore, a case study was conducted to demonstrate the suggested novel methodology.\n\n## 3\\. Methodology\n\nThe novel methodology presents a systematic combination of quantitative and qualitative reliability analysis approaches to ship system reliability by combining DFTA, FMECA, and BBN to address some observed gaps in the literature. This includes, for example, not explicitly defining component [criticality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/criticality \"Learn more about criticality from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") to system availability or prioritising maintenance actions based on the severity of failures in relation to vessel operating needs and operator-led maintenance planning. A methodical approach to system [dependability](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/dependability \"Learn more about dependability from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") analysis is necessary to provide solutions for these issues. Therefore, this research presents a unique technique for conducting component criticality analysis by utilising the particular strengths of combined reliability tools as presented in [Fig. 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#fig1).\n\n![Fig. 1](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0029801823001506-gr1.jpg)\n\n1.

[Download : Download full-size image](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0029801823001506-gr1.jpg \"Download full-size image\")\n\nFig. 1. Flowchart of novel methodology.\n\n### 3.1. Subjective inputs\n\nA key difficulty in maintenance planning is handling equipment defects that are not fully addressed in [OEM](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/original-equipment-manufacturer \"Learn more about OEM from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") maintenance and troubleshooting manuals, such as environment-related faults, design restrictions, incorrect application, or unsuitable operation. These sorts of defects typically result in frequent equipment failures and [performance deterioration](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/performance-deterioration \"Learn more about performance deterioration from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), reducing system reliability and overall platform availability. However, because these defects are not well documented by the OEM and may not have been routinely experienced by operators on that or similar equipment. It is thus difficult to capture for reliability and maintenance analysis. In this context, information from operators on problems and maintenance issues would be required, thus the use of FMECA in this research.\n\n#### 3.1.1. FMECA\n\nFMECA is widely applied in maintenance and risk analysis to provide clear understanding and procedure on what could go wrong, how it could go wrong, why it goes wrong, and how it can be corrected or addressed ([Marving Rausand and Arnljot, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib47)). The Criticality Analysis (CA) provides a means of identifying the events, occurrence or components that need more attention to avoid more serious or catastrophic situations([Melani et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib48)). FMECA is a bottom-up approach which provides a [systematic methodology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/systematic-methodology \"Learn more about systematic methodology from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") to gain deep insight on failures and their course on an equipment or system. Therefore, measuring criticality in FMECA helps to explicitly bring out the most critical component failure which can assist in maintenance actions and planning. In this regard subjective operator inputs were obtained using FMECA, the relevance of which can be described in 2 folds. The first is to evaluate operator sentiments and priorities specially to do with failures and maintenance challenges such as expertise and causes of extended [down times](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/downtime \"Learn more about down times from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). This was also used to establish maintenance critical failures and machinery parts. The second aspect was to validate critical components obtained using DFTA qualitative analysis. Therefore, to establish these 2 goals using FMECA analysis a questionnaire was produced and distributed using the Qualtrics survey software; [Table 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#tbl1) is a template of the FMECA table used.\n\nTable 1. Sample FMECA table.\n\n| Subsystem | Component | Function | Description of Failure | Effects of Failure | Safeguards | Criticality | Severity | Likelihood | RPN |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  | **Mode** | **Causes** | **Detection** | **Local** | **Global** | **Influence** | **TTR** | **Prevention** | **Mitigation** | **1–10** | **1–10** | **1–10** | **CxSxL** |\n|   \n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|   \n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|   \n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\nThe survey questions were aimed at identifying components that presents the greatest challenge to the conduct of maintenance onboard using [risk priority number](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/risk-priority-number \"Learn more about risk priority number from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). The RPN use 3 categorical variables namely identification, severity and likelihood usually measured in a linear scale based on increasing importance i.e 1 – 10. The scale used for the analysis is presented in [Table 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#tbl2), which shows the linear and Likert scale including colour codes representing respective scale values ([Jeong et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib33); [Tan et al., 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib62)).\n\nTable 2. Definition of Criteria.\n\n![](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0029801823001506-fx1.jpg)\n\nFurthermore, in this study, criticality was employed instead of [detectability](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/detectability \"Learn more about detectability from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") since enhanced sensor and monitoring have substantially increased the level at which problems are identified, either through set alarm levels or an emergency shutdown system. For the sake of clarity, criticality, determines the immediate impact of failure event to the equipment availability and functions. Therefore, a failure mode due to which the ship will not achieve one or more of the mission's targets and/or the safety of whole vessel is at risk until the failure is rectified([NASA, 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib50)). The next is Severity, severity assesses how the failure impacts on the operational availability of the equipment or system regarding normal operation and the duration it takes to be repaired or restored to normal operational levels. Severity is described as the worst potential consequence of the failure determined by the degree of injury, property damage or system damage that could occur. Lastly, likelihood and refers to the failure rate of the component including possibility and frequency of the fault occurring over a certain time frame ([DoD, 1980](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib22)).\n\nThe above explanation provides a guide to help respondents assess all the criteria against the candidate failures and components. Thereafter the responses were aggregated through a weight system to obtain single outcome to quantify the 3 criteria needed for calculating the RPN which are Criticality (C), Severity (S) and Likelihood (L). The RPN was used to get the mission criticality of the components or faults which is given by RPN = CxSxL scored on a scale 1–100; 1 being minor or low and 100 being very high score as regards impact. The FMECA was conducted through a survey completed by the engineering personnel of the organisation most of whom are either electrical or marine engineers with varied level of technical knowledge and experience. In this regard, a 2-weight system was introduced to account for experience and expertise, as presented in [Table 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#tbl3). Accordingly, all individual inputs were evaluated to reflect years of experience and specialisation of the respondents. For instance, response on piston failure by a marine engineer with 12 years’ experience will have more weight compared to that of electrical engineer with same experience and verse [vasa](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/vasa \"Learn more about vasa from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") if the response were to be on [alternator](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/alternator \"Learn more about alternator from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") parts.\n\nTable 3. FMECA Respondents and weights.\n\n| Experience | Weights | S | Weights | Ag Weight | Applied weight (%) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 0–5years | 50 | WKO/WKD | 0 | 50 + 0 | 0.5 |\n| 5–11 years | 60 | WKDWEO/MEO | 0 | 60 + 0 | 0.6 |\n| 11–15 years | 65 | WEO/MEO | 5 | 65 + 5 | 0.7 |\n| 15–20 years | 70 | FSWEO/FSMEO | 10 | 70 + 10 | 0.8 |\n| 20–24 years | 75 | FSMO/FSG CMDR | 15 | 75 + 15 | 0.9 |\n| 24–28 years | 80 | FSMO/FSG CMDR | 20 | 80 + 20 | 1 |\n| 28–35 years | 100 | FSG CMDR | 0 | 100 + 0 | 1 |\n\nAdopting the above weights, individual responses were evaluated according to experience and specialisation to obtain the population mean, equation [(1)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#fd1). Thereafter a weighted average is taken for each grouped experience, equation [(2)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#fd2), which provides single category for criticality analysis to obtain the RPN using equation [(3)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#fd3).

Objective inputs\n\nThe methodology adopted in this research draws from multiple data sources some of which are raw machinery log data, [maintenance and repair](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/repair-and-maintenance \"Learn more about maintenance and repair from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") data including technical reports, others are output from tools used in the research. This process enables a more robust analysis especially considering that the duration of the research will not allow verification or implementation of the methodology onboard. Accordingly, the objective inputs are independent numerical variables and not controlled by the modeler. These includes failure rates obtained from machinery failure data used as inputs for the DFTA, RPN values from FMECA, and MCS probabilities from the DFTA results used as inputs in the BBN. Furthermore, availability percentages from the BBN were used to build the DSS model which was complemented by MCS from the DFTA.\n\n#### 3.2.1. DFTA\n\nThe dynamic [fault tree analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/fault-tree-analysis \"Learn more about fault tree analysis from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") is an extension of standard fault tree analysis that provides for time or sequence dependent analysis and can also prioritise events for analysis. DFTA is selected for this study in order to utilise its system dependent relationship on the effect of component failures. The DFTA tool used for machinery/system reliability and availability analysis used input data generated from the operational records of 4 [diesel](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/diesel \"Learn more about diesel from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") generators for a ship [power generation system](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/power-generation-system \"Learn more about power generation system from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). Therefore, a DFTA structure representing the functional ship power generation system as well as the individual diesel generators was built. System reliability in DFTA involves generating a qualitative model of the fault tree usually from the [minimal cut sets](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/minimal-cut-set \"Learn more about minimal cut sets from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") on the [logic gate](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/logic-gate \"Learn more about logic gate from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of the fault tree. Thereafter, [quantitative analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/quantitative-measurement \"Learn more about quantitative analysis from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") using reliability and [maintainability](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/maintainability \"Learn more about maintainability from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") data such as failure rates/frequency, failure probability, [mean time to failure](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/mean-time-to-failure \"Learn more about mean time to failure from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") or repair rate can be used ([Relex et al., 2003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib55)), by calculating the unavailability and the unreliability of the system to be done.\n\nAccordingly, failure and maintenance data over a period of 6 calendar years obtained from the maintenance records was processed to generate components failure rates (⋌) based on equation [(5)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#fd5). The model structure was built using both static and dynamic FT gates and events to reflect the mode of failures and in other cases dependency and sequence. Therefore, top events and sub-events were modelled using dynamic gates while gates connecting to the main system were modelled using static FTs this procedure is necessary to reduce memory usage and improve calculation time. The probabilities for the static gates used were generally AND gate equation [(6)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#fd6), OR gate equation [(7)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#fd7) and Voting gate . Voting gate (equation [(8)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#fd8)) account for multiple connected components (_k out of n_) such as injection nozzles, cylinder blocks, fuel day tanks or supply line, this is because correct functioning of system requires all component but is not necessarily impaired due to a few faulty ones.equation 5$<math><mrow is=\"true\"><mo is=\"true\">⋌</mo><mo linebreak=\"badbreak\" is=\"true\">=</mo><mfrac is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">n</mi><mi is=\"true\">τ</mi></mfrac></mrow></math>$Where n is number of failures (10<sup>6</sup>) and $<math><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">τ</mi></mrow></math>$ is aggregated time in service of individual DG.

BBN\n\nBayesian belief networks provide efficient and flexible platform for the conduct of numerical analysis to aid decision making impacted by conflicting priorities. BBNs can be up dated with new data at any point during the analysis thereby providing a very efficient tool for decision support system especially for complex system maintenance analysis([Sakar et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib58)). [BBN analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/electric-network-analysis \"Learn more about BBN analysis from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") is conducted based on DAG structure consisting of nodes of various shapes representing events and their probabilities, connected to arrows indicating dependencies or influence. [Conditional probability](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/conditional-probability \"Learn more about Conditional probability from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") tables (CPT) of discrete or continues variables provide inputs for the nodes in the influence diagrams. The CPT can be updated according to data availability which provide the evidence (E) and event occurring. The evidence is used by the BN's inference engine to update the prior occurrence of event, equation [(13)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#fd13) ([F.V. Jensen, 2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib29)).equation 13$<math><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">P</mi><mrow is=\"true\"><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">(</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">U</mi><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">|</mo><mi is=\"true\">E</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">)</mo></mrow><mo linebreak=\"badbreak\" is=\"true\">=</mo><mfrac is=\"true\"><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">P</mi><mrow is=\"true\"><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">(</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">U</mi><mo is=\"true\">,</mo><mi is=\"true\">E</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">P</mi><mrow is=\"true\"><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">(</mo><mi is=\"true\">E</mi><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mfrac><mo linebreak=\"badbreak\" is=\"true\">=</mo><mfrac is=\"true\"><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">P</mi><mrow is=\"true\"><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">(</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">U</mi><mo is=\"true\">,</mo><mi is=\"true\">E</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mrow is=\"true\"><msub is=\"true\"><mo is=\"true\">∑</mo><mi is=\"true\">U</mi></msub><mi is=\"true\">P</mi><mrow is=\"true\"><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">(</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">U</mi><mo is=\"true\">,</mo><mi is=\"true\">E</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mfrac></mrow></math>$\n\nThe above equation represents the overall structure of the influence diagram for a BN structure analysis. In this case the conditional probabilities of failure are presented as parent event and faults are presented as children P (Failure│Fault event). In this regard the influence diagrams for the building the maintenance DSS was generated using the CPT output of BBN which provides the availability of the DGs. Overall, the parent/child relationship of the BN structure is derived from the Bayesian theorem and chain rule that enables the quantification of relationships among the variables. Hence the [joint probability distribution](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/joint-probability-distribution \"Learn more about joint probability distribution from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") _of P(U)_ represented by child(ren) _A_<sub><em>i</em></sub> for each node on the network can be evaluated based on equation [(14)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#fd14).equation 14$<math><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">P</mi><mrow is=\"true\"><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">(</mo><mi is=\"true\">U</mi><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">)</mo></mrow><mo linebreak=\"badbreak\" is=\"true\">=</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><munderover is=\"true\"><mo is=\"true\">∏</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">i</mi><mo linebreak=\"badbreak\" is=\"true\">=</mo><mn is=\"true\">1</mn></mrow><mi is=\"true\">n</mi></munderover><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">P</mi><mrow is=\"true\"><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">(</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">A</mi><mi is=\"true\">i</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">|</mo><mi is=\"true\">P</mi><mi is=\"true\">a</mi><mrow is=\"true\"><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">(</mo><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">A</mi><mi is=\"true\">i</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>$Where _Pa(A_<sub><em>i</em></sub>_)_ are the parents of _Ai in P(U)_ reflects the overall relation of the nodes in the network.\n\nAccordingly, the Bayesian network and influence diagram for the DSS were build using the Genie software ([BayesFusion, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib7)). Building the DSS require different approach as it requires utility inputs as value for decision choices. Therefore, first step in BBN analysis was to get sub-system availability using the MCS probability of occurrence obtained from the [DFT](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/density-functional-theory \"Learn more about DFT from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") analysis used as probabilities for the CPT of all the chance nodes. The BN chance nodes have 3 levels, first level identifies the probability of occurrence of the fault as a child of a component failure indicating either failed or not failed. The failure node represent components that are linked as child nodes to subsystem node which provides the output as either available or not available depending on probability of occurrence of MCS in CPT; [Fig. 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#fig2) presents a simple sketch of the BBN structure node relationships and options.\n\n![Fig. 2](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0029801823001506-gr2.jpg)\n\n1.

BBN structure node relationships and options.\n\nThe BN availability output together with the FMECA RPN provides vital inputs for the DSS in addition to maintenance strategy choices. The influence diagram for the maintenance decision support use additional nodes namely, decision and utility (value) nodes, each of which provides a complementary evaluation of the input variables. The decision nodes take in variable assigned by the [decision maker](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/decision-maker \"Learn more about decision maker from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") in order to model available decision variables ([BayesFusion, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib7)). In this case the decision variables are the maintenance strategy options in [Table 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#tbl4).The second node is the value node also called utility, this node provides a measure of the [desirability](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/desirability \"Learn more about desirability from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of the output of the decision process and quantified by the utility of each possible outcome of the [parent node](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/parent-node \"Learn more about parent node from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") ([BayesFusion, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib7)). The last node is the chance nodes which contain [random variables](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/random-variable-xi \"Learn more about random variables from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") representing uncertainties or probabilities that are relevant to the occurrence of the events([BayesFusion, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib7)). As explained earlier, they represent probabilities of MCS of the components of each sub-system as inputs in CPT. Therefore, these 3 nodes formed the methodology of the DSS which interpret the desired outcomes based on the available choices while; the value node takes in continues variables as a measure of the parent nodes (subcomponent) criticality. In this way the utility value nodes provide the expected utility of a parent node or top event feeding it to decision node to get its availability percentage; while the decision node in the influence diagram contains maintenance decision choices which are dependent on the RPN variables inputs in value nodes as shown [Table 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#tbl5).\n\nTable 4. Maintenance strategy options.\n\n| Maintenance Strategy | Definition | RPN Range |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Corrective Action | This is recommended for very high to high mission critical component or faults for example sea water supply pump impeller, fuel supply pump, automatic voltage regulator faults etc. | 75–100 |\n| Condition Monitoring | This strategy serves as intervention to ensure system availability targeted at component or failures whose early identification could avert major operational delays. | 55–75 |\n| Planned Maintenance System | The PMS maintenance choices prioritise time dependent component failures with no immediate impacts to availability repair requirements. | 35–55 |\n| Delay Action | Delay action maintenance choice is directed at those components with good resilience or sufficient redundancy such that there is little or no danger to personnel and system safety. | 0–35 |\n\nTable 5. DSS ranking scale.\n\n![](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0029801823001506-fx2.jpg)\n\nThe definition in [Table 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#tbl4) provide a general guidance in the maintenance selection process in the DSS and used in the decision nodes. Making the selection depend on 2 variables which include the RPN and availability. In this regard the normalised RPN factors down time, maintenance cost and lost utility due to failure have been accounted for; while the availability factors in component availability within operational period were equally addressed. Hence all the DGs are evaluated based on 2 main factors which are availability and system criticality based on RPN values as presented in [Table 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#tbl5).\n\n## 4\\. Case study\n\nThe [power generation system](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/power-generation-system \"Learn more about power generation system from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") provides the most vital utility on board ships which suggests the level of redundancy and design resilience usually provided by ship builders. These features are common for both merchant and [naval ships](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/warship \"Learn more about naval ships from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") though with significant high operational demand for the naval platforms. Failure of the [power generation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/power-generation \"Learn more about power generation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") system for naval platforms has several implications especially considering the number of personnel onboard, and vulnerability due to loss of weapons, surveillance and habitation platforms usage. The location and type of failure are important factors to be considered in maintenance planning due to logistics and OEM related concerns. In this regard the suggested case study implements a novel methodology through the combination of reliability analysis tools to address maintenance challnegs on the power generation plant onboard and offshore patrol vessel (OPV).\n\nAccordingly, data analysis for this research was designed to cover subjective and objective analysis. The subjective aspect of the case study provides intuitive guidance on model quality, while the objective part of the methodology provides numerical analysis using failure rates as inputs. The FMECA analysis presents experts judgement about failure and critical system component while the DFTA is a [quantitative analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/quantitative-measurement \"Learn more about quantitative analysis from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") on system [component reliability](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/component-reliability \"Learn more about component reliability from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). The inputs for the BN analysis were obtained from both failure rates and MCS output of the DFT analysis, while RPN numbers from FMECA analysis were used as bases for maintenance strategy selection of individual generators. Therefore, data used for the analysis includes FMECA conducted via online survey, failure rates using [maintenance and repair](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/repair-and-maintenance \"Learn more about maintenance and repair from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") data collected from 4 marine [diesel](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/diesel \"Learn more about diesel from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") generator plants, each rated at 400 kW and can be operated parallel or individual. This was followed by discussion about operation and maintenance process onboard including wider discussion to gain expert perception on maintenance process in the fleet.\n\n### 4.1. Subjective analysis\n\nFMECA analysis were conducted, for the marine DGs targeted at getting expert opinion on failures mechanism and how the DGs are impact by these failures. It also provides experts judgement on how this failure affect platform availability due to issues such as, spare parts availability, technical expertise, delays due to OEM and impact of the operational environment including practices. These outcomes from the FMECA were used to generate RPN number and normalised to obtain the mission critical component, [Table 6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#tbl6) shows respondents experience and assigned weights. The assign weights are product of experience in years and positions held.\n\nTable 6. FMECA Respondents and weights.\n\n| Positions | Respondents | Experience | Ag Weight | Applied weight (%) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| WKO/WKD | 2 | 0–5years | 50 + 0 | 0.5 |\n| WKDWEO/MEO | 2 | 5–11 years | 60 + 0 | 0.6 |\n| WEO/MEO | 4 | 11–15 years | 65 + 5 | 0.7 |\n| FSWEO/FSMEO | 5 | 15–20 years | 70 + 10 | 0.8 |\n| FSMO/FSG CMDR | 3 | 20–24 years | 75 + 15 | 0.9 |\n| FSMO/FSG CMDR | 2 | 24–28 years | 80 + 20 | 1 |\n| FSG CMDR | 2 | 28–35 years | 100 + 0 | 1 |\n\nThe FMECA survey consisted of about 20 questions on various types of faults and failure conditions covering DG system including the [alternator](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/alternator \"Learn more about alternator from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). All respondents are engineers with varying experience and specialisation. The 2 specializations are Marine and Weapon Electrical Engineers with experience levels between 5 and 35 years of service considering position occupied. The 2 variables, namely experience and specialisation were used as weights in percentages and applied to individual inputs of the respondents. Accordingly, all individual inputs were evaluated to reflect years of experience and specialisation of the respondents based on equation [(14)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#fd14). Adopting the above weights, individual responses were evaluated according to experience and specialisation to obtain the population mean equation [(15)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#fd15).equation 14$<math><mrow is=\"true\"><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">W</mi><mn is=\"true\">1</mn></msub><mo linebreak=\"badbreak\" is=\"true\">=</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><munderover is=\"true\"><mo is=\"true\">∑</mo><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">i</mi><mo linebreak=\"badbreak\" is=\"true\">&gt;</mo><mn is=\"true\">0</mn></mrow><mi is=\"true\">n</mi></munderover><mrow is=\"true\"><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">C</mi><mn is=\"true\">1</mn></msub><mrow is=\"true\"><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">(</mo><mfrac is=\"true\"><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">e</mi><mo linebreak=\"badbreak\" is=\"true\">+</mo><mi is=\"true\">s</mi></mrow><mn is=\"true\">100</mn></mfrac><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">)</mo></mrow><mo linebreak=\"badbreak\" is=\"true\">+</mo></mrow></mrow><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">C</mi><mn is=\"true\">2</mn></msub><mrow is=\"true\"><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">(</mo><mfrac is=\"true\"><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">e</mi><mo linebreak=\"badbreak\" is=\"true\">+</mo><mi is=\"true\">s</mi></mrow><mn is=\"true\">100</mn></mfrac><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">)</mo></mrow><mo is=\"true\">…</mo><mo is=\"true\">.</mo><mo is=\"true\">.</mo><msub is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">C</mi><mi is=\"true\">i</mi></msub><mrow is=\"true\"><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">(</mo><mfrac is=\"true\"><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">e</mi><mo linebreak=\"badbreak\" is=\"true\">+</mo><mi is=\"true\">s</mi></mrow><mn is=\"true\">100</mn></mfrac><mo stretchy=\"true\" is=\"true\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></math>$Where _W_<sub><em>1</em></sub> is the weighted component score for rank 1, n is the number of respondents in that rank, C is evaluated criterion.equation 15$<math><mrow is=\"true\"><mi is=\"true\">μ</mi><mo linebreak=\"badbreak\" is=\"true\">=</mo><mfrac is=\"true\"><mrow is=\"true\"><mo is=\"true\">∑</mo><mi is=\"true\">x</mi></mrow><mi is=\"true\">N</mi></mfrac></mrow></math>$Where μ is the population mean, x = data values, N = number of samples.\n\nUsing the population mean for each group the weighted RPN for each subsystem and component was evaluated and normalised to ≤100 as presented in [Table 7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#tbl7).\n\nTable 7. FMECA RPN values of Most critical failures.\n\n![](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0029801823001506-fx3.jpg)\n\n### 4.2. Objective analysis\n\nThe objective phase of the case study provides a system reliability analysis using quantitative failure rates values of the 4 marine DGs, therefore providing a numerically objective output. The DFTA results includes component reliability, importance measures (criticality) and cut sets, which provide a significant understanding on the DGs reliability. However, it was difficult to identify specific repair, maintenance or component failure that present the highest challenge to the operators. Therefore, considering that the MCS is a combination of minimum number of events which must occur for the top event to occur (component failure); it therefor provides a good source of variables for building the BBN while taking additional inputs from the FMECA as RPN. Accordingly, this study is utilising the MCS of the DFTA to build the BN analysis by identifying top 10 most critical components as presented in [Table 7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#tbl7) above.\n\nThe DFTA analysis provides both qualitative and quantitative calculations. The qualitative analysis is performed using the structure of the DFTA dependent on logic properties of the gates, while the quantitative analysis uses MRO data such as failure rate, [MTBF](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/mtbf \"Learn more about MTBF from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), and frequency. The quantitative analysis outputs are objective results that includes system unreliability, unavailability and reliability importance measures which provide critical components failures. However, the MCS evaluation is based on the output evaluated using the logic combination of the top event occurrence usually from left to right. Therefore, to obtain the MCS the DFTA structure representing each DG was built based on the functional relationship and system boundary of the sub-systems of the respective marine DGs. MCS are product of the fault tree which forms the failure path of an evaluated fault tree, i.e the smallest set of basic events, which if they all occur will result in the top event occurring ([NASA, 2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib49)). However, it is important to note that a single basic event can equally form a cut set depending on the arrangement of the fault tree, [Fig. 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#fig3) provides some instance of MCS. Sub-system 1 having an AND gate fails only when all the events have occurred however the intermediate OR gate fail when any of its BEs occur, while in the case of sub-system 2, the occurrence of BE7 or BE8 is an MCS. Similarly, occurrence of any of the BEs in sub-system 3 forms a cut set for the sub-system. This highlights potential area where improvements can be achieved through alternative maintenance approach, redesign or simply altering the system to improve its reliability.\n\n![Fig. 3](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0029801823001506-gr3.jpg)\n\n1.

Instances of MCS formation.\n\nThe next step after the MCSs were obtained was to build the BBN structure using the MCS probability of occurrence as inputs to the CPT. Therefore, using a bottom-up approach, discrete chance nodes were used to model faults which are then connected to parent chance nodes representing component having probability values as inputs to the CPT, the top 10 MCS used for building the BBN are contained in [Table 8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#tbl8). Overall, 8 subsystems and dependent components were modelled and analysed in the BN structure. The component chance nodes are linked to all possible faults including faults in other subsystems that could elicit multiple component failures that could result to greater maintenance or availability problems. The flexibility in BN which allows modelling CCF is very helpful in presenting complex failure interactions between components that serve many systems or subsystems.\n\nTable 8. Top 10 cut sets for DG1-4.\n\n| DG1 | DG 2 | DG3 | DG4 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Crankshaft journal failure | Fuel Injection pump Mechanical failure | Crankshaft journal failure | HP fuel pipe leakages |\n| Fuel Filter (1&2) | FW Heat Exchanger Fouling | FW Heat Exchanger Fouling | FW Heat exchanger tube fouling |\n| Sea Chest blockage | Tappet clearance (In&Ex) | RW impeller Damage | Rocker arm and Tappets clearance |\n| Tappet clearance (In&Ex) | Burnt top cylinder gasket | Turbo charger lub failure | Governor drive |\n| Cylinder Head sealing | Clogged Air filter | Cylinder head gasket damage | Intercooler fins fouling |\n| Fuel Lift pump defects | Injector Nozzle faults | Injector nozzles faults | Turbo charger |\n| Turbo Charger leakages | Clogged Air filter | blocked fuel filter | Cylinder Head gasket damage |\n| Cylinder jacket cracks | Oil filter | Piston crown damage | Loose cylinder head bolts |\n| Low fuel pressure | No Fuel Supply | Tappet clearance | Clogged air filter |\n| RW water impeller | Defective fuel pump | Loose cylinder head bolts | Injector camshaft failure |\n\nThe process also enables more efficiently evaluation of the MCS and there impacts were more highlighted using BN analysis, hence one of the many reasons of using BN for this analysis. Moreover, the cumulative probability of the child nodes occurrence determines the operational health condition of the parent component node at the sub-system level; [Fig. 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#fig4) is a sample of the BBN structure for DG2, showing 3 out of the 8 subsystem and an abridge part of the CPT.\n\n![Fig. 4](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0029801823001506-gr4.jpg)\n\n1.

Sample BBN for DG2 showing 3 subsystems and CPT tables.\n\nA complete model for DG 3 containing all 8 sub-systems and their nodes is shown in [Fig. 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#fig5). As can be seen in the structure the yellow nodes represent the failure cause, the light green nodes represent component failure while the sub-system are rectangle grey nodes with bar chart and the topmost blue node represents the DG. The arrows from the nodes are linked across sub-system to model common cause faults (CCF), which is typical of many [mechanical systems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/mechanical-systems \"Learn more about mechanical systems from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") especially due to temperature and load related failures. The BBN model clearly present those CCFs that can impact multiple subsystems hence provides a good reference point for the DSS.\n\n![Fig. 5](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0029801823001506-gr5.jpg)\n\n1.

BBN structure for DG 3.\n\nThe DSS was built on the existing BN structure and takes inputs from all the 8 subsystems and RPN values. Therefore, within the DSS process the non-availability of subsystem obtained in the BN is translated to reflect the ranking table in line with RPN structure as earlier presented in [Table 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#tbl5). Additional nodes namely decision and value nodes were used in conjunction with the chance nodes. The decision nodes are used to represent variables controlled by the [decision maker](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/decision-maker \"Learn more about decision maker from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") while the value nodes provide a measure of the [desirability](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/desirability \"Learn more about desirability from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of the decision outcomes based on DSS process as shown in [Fig. 6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#fig6).\n\n![Fig. 6](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0029801823001506-gr6.jpg)\n\n1.

DSS process schematic.\n\nFollowing the above process, the DSS had 2 decision nodes with maintenance strategy and criticality level options as input. Accordingly, the value nodes had RPN values that serve as measurement of how the operators perceive the impact of failure on the DGs while ship operational availability has RPN as its inputs. In this regard the 8 chance nodes connect to value node provides the DG availability inputs in percentages while the 2 decision nodes feed in decision choices as regards the DGs availability and sub-system criticality as shown in [Fig. 7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#fig7).\n\n![Fig. 7](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0029801823001506-gr7.jpg)\n\n1.

Results and discussion\n\nThis section presents the results of the analysis based on the implementation of the presented methodology and DGs in the case study. This section will start with the subjective analysis result on the FMECA output, thereafter the objective aspect will be presented to cover DFTA MCS use for BBN as well as the BN and DSS results.\n\n### 5.1. FMECA RPN\n\nThe FMECA survey outputs provides a very important input to the overall analysis as regards what may have not been carefully accounted for in the maintenance and repair data collected from the DGs. Moreover, the MRO used was for and individual ship while the FMECA data was the response from over 20 experts with varying professional experience. Though the FMECA has in no way influenced the DFTA results it was mainly used to complement it for the second aspect of the BBN analysis which is the maintenance DSS. The fact that DFTA cannot account for issues to do with unplanned downtime, quality of replacement parts, design related unreliability and generic [human factor](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/ergonomics \"Learn more about human factor from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") concern. The FMECA helps in addressing these issues as well as other environmentally induced failures which were not factored during installation but were not necessarily design related. Therefore, the FMECA survey was designed to capture some of these problems, to also highlight how the operators evaluated the most critical failures to ship availability and repairs.\n\nIt is important to understand the peculiarities and the condition of [Naval ship](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/warship \"Learn more about Naval ship from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") operations, as regard [operational requirements](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/operational-requirement \"Learn more about operational requirements from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and system demand onboard. A [standard operating procedure](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/standard-operating-procedure \"Learn more about standard operating procedure from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") for naval ships is parallel operation of DGs during certain exercises, navigational circumstances and load demands. In this regard, despite the redundancy in [power generation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/power-generation \"Learn more about power generation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") system it is usual to have load shading due to high demands from other utilities. Therefore, the power generation system is one system that naval ships cannot afford to compromised.\n\nIt is therefore common to have ships undertake repairs while under way to ensure that at least 2 DGs are available, hence any repair that cannot be undertaken by ship's staff while underway is viewed as critical and can affect overall ship availability or deployments. The results of the FMECA highlights these critical failures which may not be seen as important by OEMs, but the operator's environment and operational circumstance made it so. Consequently, [Table 9](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#tbl9) above, is the FMECA RPN values obtained from response of operators, which details how the operators perceive the importance of DGs against the navy's operational demands, maintenance practice and capabilities including environmental conditions.\n\nTable 9. FMECA RPN values of Most critical failures.\n\n![](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0029801823001506-fx4.jpg)\n\nA look at the table indicates majority of faults with low likelihood have high criticality and severity values. Therefore, taking from the definition of these 2 factors the operators are more concern with failures that affects ship availability. This is not to say safety is not of concern, in fact the threat to safety as regards loss in power generation output could be in 2 folds. First is safety and security both external and internal to the ship. The second is operational external safety to do with threats to national assets and safety of navigation which is equally a safety concern to personnel onboard. Hence, faults that can be fixed while underway or which do not expose the ship to danger i.e. loss of 2 out of the 4 DGs is within acceptable limits. Therefore, consideration for the maintenance strategy selection needs to be dynamic to reflect the prevailing operational and health condition of the DGs. Hence the need to consider the interaction between objective and subjective data sources to provide balance in the DSS analysis.\n\n### 5.2. DFTA\n\nMCS obtained through DFTA for individual sub systems were used as inputs to build the BN probability analysis. MCS being a combination of events or failures that leads to the system or subsystem failure can be efficiently utilised to improve system availability. Nonetheless, some failures can be triggered by a fault in another system, especially in marine diesel generators where many faults are interrelated due to system dependencies. For instance, one of the most important failures on the DGs was [crank case](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/crank-case \"Learn more about crank case from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") failure but influenced by multiple factors from other subsystem such as the lubricating system and the cooling freshwater system as well as the air distribution system. This makes it difficult to isolate failure to faults, so the approach in this research is to identify the MCS, and link the components and their probability of occurrence, as shown in [Table 10](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#tbl10). This way the operators will be able prioritise maintenance and identify spare parts shortages as necessary.\n\nTable 10. Top 10 cut set and probability of occurrence.\n\n| DG1 | Probability | DG 2 | Probability | DG3 | Probability | DG4 | Probability |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Crankshaft journal failure | 0.49 | Fuel Injection pump Mechanical failure | 0.82 | Crankshaft journal failure | 0.78 | HP fuel pipe leakages | 0.85 |\n| Fuel Filter (1&2) | 0.87 | FW Heat Exchanger Fouling | 0.67 | FW Heat Exchanger Fouling | 0.94 | FW Heat exchanger tube fouling | 0.7 |\n| Sea Chest blockage | 0.71 | Tappet clearance (In&Ex) | 0.82 | RW impeller Damage | 0.84 | Rocker arm and Tappets clearance | 0.86 |\n| Tappet clearance (In&Ex) | 0.52 | Burnt top cylinder gasket | 0.86 | Turbo charger lub failure | 0.75 | Governor drive | 0.77 |\n| Cylinder Head sealing | 0.75 | Clogged Air filter | 0.75 | Cylinder head gasket damage | 0.72 | intercooler fins fouling | 0.53 |\n| Fuel Lift pump defects | 0.82 | Injector Nozzle faults | 0.74 | Injector nozzles cylinder | 0.72 | Turbo charger | 0.52 |\n| Turbo Charger leakages | 0.54 | Clogged Air filter | 0.76 | blacked fuel filter | 0.76 | Cylinder Head gasket damage | 0.73 |\n| Cylinder jacket cracks | 0.5 | Oil filter | 0.46 | Piston crown damage | 0.87 | Loose cylinder head bolts | 0.64 |\n| Low fuel pressure | 0.63 | No Fuel Supply | 0.78 | Tappet clearance | 0.8 | Clogged air filter |  |\n| RW water impeller | 0.84 | Defective fuel pump | 0.82 | Loose cylinder head bolts | 0.68 | Injector camshaft failure | 0.54 |\n\nMoreover, another important factor with MCS is that events are considered based on their contribution to failure not only occurrence. In some cases, failure occurrence may not necessarily be the reason why a component becomes critical to maintenance. In most cases factors such as [down time](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/downtime \"Learn more about down time from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), cost of repairs and repair capability could be major concerns for operators. For Instance, overheating related failures are dominated by sea water [heat exchanger](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/heat-exchanger \"Learn more about heat exchanger from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") scale build-up and are mainly of concern because of the envisaged operational interruption. However, [lubrication system](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/lubrication-system \"Learn more about lubrication system from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") failures or losing alternator exciter which seldom happens but their occurrence could lead to serious consequence. These types of faults are well captured by MCS formation in DFT analysis, however the DFTA structure does not support the modelling of MCS that can develop to CCF covering more than one subsystem. Hence BBN was adopted to overcome the challenge of CCF, while accommodating course effect analysis considering multiple operational factors.\n\n### 5.3. BBN and maintenance DSS\n\nPower generations system reliability is of great concern for all ship operators irrespective of sector, as it provides the highest utility and ensures collective safety of operators, passengers, equipment and cargo. In this regard the BBN model investigated multiple failure types and their impact on components and DG availability. Modelled components were from DFTA MCS and their failure probability from the collected MRO data. This input was used to obtain the availability for individual DGs as well as the main subsystems modelled, as shown in [Table 11](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#tbl11). The results shows that all 4 DGs had varying degrees of availability with DG2 being slightly more available as compared to the rest. The subsystem availability particularly that of the lubricating system of DG2 at 75% is an important pointer. Moreover, the lubricating subsystem is one of the most reliable subsystems in most DGs, this can be attributed to the centrality of its function particularly to the moving parts and heat transfer. On the other hand, a very critical situation is presented in the cooling system with availability values below 40% which is far below the expected availability of the operator. The low availability values could be linked to the sea chest blockages which can be very frequent and rapid due to scale build-up on the [cooling fins](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/cooling-fin \"Learn more about cooling fins from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). Nonetheless, the cooling system for the ships in question has at least 4 redundant sources of water supply in addition to the inline source, while this design helps reduce the risk of overheating due to delays in switching water sources. It is important that an [early warning system](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/early-warning-system \"Learn more about early warning system from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") is provided to ensure that watch keepers are adequately alerted at the onset of any pressure reduction in water supply or temperature increase for at least 10 min with no corresponding increase in demands or beyond normal threshold.\n\nTable 11. BBN DG and Component availability.\n\n| DG | DG1 | DG2 | DG3 | DG4 | Empty Cell |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Availability | 50% | 53% | 48% | 47% |  |\n| Subsystem Availability |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Cylinder Block | 47% | 43% | 44% | 44% |  |\n| PTO | 60% | 56% | 50% | 60% |  |\n| Cooling | 37% | 39% | 39% | 37% |  |\n| Fuel System | 43% | 45% | 44% | 44% |  |\n| Air Distribution | 50% | 52% | 52% | 42% |  |\n| Lubrication | 62% | 75% | 56% | 55% |  |\n| Inlet and Exhaust | 60% | 63% | 62% | 58% |  |\n| Alternator | 59% | 52% | 59% | 57% |  |\n\nFurthermore, the DG availability can be used independently to aid maintenance planning, in that the subsystem availability indicates where maintenance effort should be directed. However, to improve maintenance decision making additional issues that influence delivery and quality of maintenance needs to be considered. In this regard the FMECA provides a solution, and it was used for building the DSS with other inputs from the availability and maintenance strategy choices. Overall, the 4 maintenance strategy options namely Corrective Action, ConMon, PMS and Delay Action. The first 2 options are meant for high critical failures or component with severe failure consequences while the last 2 are to address failures with time dependent pattern or equipment with high redundancy and low criticality. The maintenance criticality also has 4 levels which are, Very High, High, Medium and Low and these conforms' with the maintenance strategy in order of hierarchy. The same also applies to the RPN values against the maintenance strategy options.\n\nThe approach compares the criticality in decreasing priority from very high to low based on RPN numerical values where 100 represent the highest possible outcome and 0 lowest possible outcome. The RPN values provide an iterative procedure using the linear scale ranges to place components to certain maintenance strategy group. Therefore, this helps ease some of the restriction of the component criticality Likert scale, hence providing a flexible procedure to prioritise system maintenance. Accordingly, the inputs for the overall BBN DSS comprise of the subsystem RPN, critical components and their cut set as well as the relevant CCF as shown in [Table 12](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#tbl12). Consequently, using these values, the DSS was built based on the structure shown in [Fig. 8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#fig8) representing DG 2, showing the 3 additional nodes, 2 decision nodes on orange and 1 utility node in yellow. The decision node ‘Maintenance Decision’ is defined by independent variables of maintenance strategy choices and is a parent to Utility node which is a dependent variable and child to another decision node ‘RPN’. The decision node ‘RPN’ takes information representing the maintenance decision arrangements and matched with RPN criticality hierarchy based on RPN scale.\n\nTable 12. Summary of BN DSS inputs.\n\n| Sub-System | RPN | Components | MSC | CCF | Mode | Causes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Cylinder Block | 65% | 7 | 6 | 1 | Overheating | No cooling water, lubrication oil failure, vibration, gasket damage, seizure |\n| PTO | 58% | 3 | 2 | 2 | Seizure, Overheating | Missed timing, Overheating, |\n| Cooling | 64% | 6 | 2 | 3 | Reduced Cooling, No cooling | Sea chest blockages, scaling, thermostat fault, Pump failure |\n| Fuel System | 34% | 5 | 4 | 3 | Low Pressure, No supply, contamination | Air log, dirty tanks, filter blockage, fuel quality |\n| Air Distribution | 33% | 2 | 2 | 0 | Low supply, Hot air | Air filter blockage, air cooler fouling |\n| Lubrication | 3% | 3 | 2 | 0 | Low pressure, | Filter blockage, |\n| No supply, | Pump failure |\n| contamination | Seal failure |\n| Inlet and Exhaust | 0% | 4 | 4 | 3 | Missed timing, valve clearance, poor scavenge | Valve setting/tappet clearance, weak spring, valve seat, bent valve stem |\n| Alternator | 14% | 4 | 10 | 5 | Overheating, rubbing, load shedding, no output, degraded performance (low voltage/frequency) | Bearing failure.

BBN component availability and RPN.\n\nFollowing from the above, the DSS allocates percentage values between 0 and 100 to each of the 4-maintenance strategy choice for the DG based on the input data. The allocated percentage for each of the strategy determines how the maintenance action, planning and monitoring should be prioritised. This allows for flexibility regarding distribution of resources such as personnel, spare parts, logistic support and operational deployment. Furthermore, high criticality ranking for ConMon indicates the need for additional monitoring approach which can be addition of sensors, increased inspection frequency or watchkeeping attention.\n\nThe overall outcome for the maintenance strategy selection DSS of the DGs is presented in [Fig. 9](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#fig9). The analysis indicates how each of the DGs fit to a certain maintenance strategy regime as a reflection of the main variables i.e utility and RPN. In all, Corrective Action and ConMon appear to be the most preferred choice for all the DGs except for DG1 with relatively low figures in ConMon but high in PMS.\n\n![Fig. 9](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0029801823001506-gr9.jpg)\n\n1.

Maintenance DSS choice for all DGs.\n\nOnly DG1 and 2 seem to have some values for Delay Action and present high figures both Corrective Action and ConMon. This suggests that the 2 generators are highly maintenance intensive, moreover DG1 has about 54% to corrective action and DG2 is about 58% in ConMon. On the other hand, DG3 and DG4 fall in relatively similar level of priority levels except in PMS where DG4 numbers appear much higher than that of DG3. A likely reason for this could be that DG1 and 2 are located in the same engine room likewise DG 3 and 4. As such due to shared resources such as sea chest, ventilation, fuel line and local stress such vibration, the generators tend to present similar pattern of failure. Though some of these findings were not apparent to the operators prior to this research, however were consistent with similar research findings within the [shipping industry](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/shipping-industry \"Learn more about shipping industry from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") ([Goossens and Basten, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib31); [Lazakis and Ölçer, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib41); [Lazakis et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib43)) and others with focus on Naval ship platforms ([Berghout et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib8); [Tomlinson, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#bib63)).Moreover, the FMECA findings also provide additional evidence as to the [acceptability](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/acceptability \"Learn more about acceptability from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of the research findings and relevance of the methodology.\n\n## 6\\. Conclusions\n\nThe maintenance department in large organisations help to ensure platform availability through the implementation of a maintenance strategy which fits best to organisational roles. In this regard the effort of the maintenance department is to utilise the strategy within its disposal to ensure that failures are not only minimised but are managed in an economical and timely manner. Maintenance efforts onboard also ensures that ship operators meet the IMO and ISM code provision on emission reduction and safety respectively. In this regard this research paper presented a novel methodology through the combination of reliability analysis and decision support system to help provide the most efficient maintenance strategy option for a given system and components by combining DFTA, FMECA and BBN. The methodology was implemented in the presented case study of an OPV power generation system consisting of 4 marine diesel generators. Modelled components originated from MCS obtained through DFTA and their failure probability from the collected MRO data. This input was used to obtain the availability for individual DGs as well as the main subsystems modelled. The RPN from the FMECA was generic to all generators, but the MCS from the DFTA was not, hence the DFTA cut set output was the source for the component inputs that form the child nodes in the BBN for each of the 4 DGs, while failure rates were used as inputs for the CPT. The inputs provided analytical data for ships availability analysis in BN model. The maintenance DSS was built on the existing BN with additional influence diagrams nodes taking inputs from RPN and maintenance strategy choice.\n\nOverall, the results show that all 4 DGs had varying degrees of availability with DG2 being slightly more available as compared to the rest. The subsystem availability particularly that of the lubricating system of DG2 at 75% is an important pointer. On the other hand, a very critical situation is presented in the cooling system with availability values below 40% which is far below the expected availability of the operator pegged at 80%. The results overall indicates’ that Corrective Action and ConMon appear to be the most preferred choice for all the DGs except for the DG1 with relatively low figures in ConMon but high in PMS. Only DG1 and 2 seem to have some values for Delay Action and presented high figures both Corrective Action and ConMon. This suggests that the two generators are highly maintenance intensive, moreover DG1 has about 54% to corrective action and DG2 is about 58% in ConMon. On the other hand, DG3 and DG4 fall in relatively similar level of priority levels this except in PMS where DG4 numbers appear much higher than that of DG3. One of the major reasons for this could be that DG1 and 2 are located in the same engine room likewise DG 3 and 4, hence are affected by the same factors. Consequently, based on the outcome of the case study especially on subsystems with low availability values such as the cooling system, which can be linked to the sea chest blockages and scale built-up on the [cooling fins](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/cooling-fin \"Learn more about cooling fins from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). This is despite a relatively high redundancy in the cooling water sources, but delays in switch water sources could still lead to overheating. Therefore based on the results the following are recommended.\n\n-   •\n    \n    [Early warning system](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/early-warning-system \"Learn more about Early warning system from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") be provided to ensure that watch keepers are adequately alerted at the onset of any pressure reduction in water supply or temperature increase for at least 10 min with no corresponding increase in demands or beyond normal threshold.\n    \n-   •\n    \n    Provision of additional online [pressure sensors](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/pressure-probe \"Learn more about pressure sensors from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") on the sea [water line](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/water-piping-systems \"Learn more about water line from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\").\n    \n-   •\n    \n    Consider use of cooling water additives and increased flushing frequency of the cooling water tubes.\n    \n\nMoreover, further research efforts to extend the presented work could include the use and application of [artificial neural networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/artificial-neural-network \"Learn more about artificial neural networks from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") for fault detection and the development of a methodology for estimating the remaining useful life of ship system components, along with a spare parts estimation process. Furthermore, in light of shipping decarbonization, the application of the aforementioned methodology and tools can be extended to ship system reliability analysis on the impact of the use of biofuels and [alternative fuels](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/alternative-fuel \"Learn more about alternative fuels from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") on the reliability assessment of engine system components.\n\n## CRediT authorship contribution statement\n\n**Abdullahi Abdulkarim Daya:** Conceptualization, Methodology, Data Collection, Software, Validation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – original draft, Visualization. **Iraklis Lazakis:** Conceptualization, Validation, Resources, Writing - review, Supervision.\n\n## Declaration of competing interest\n\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe research is funded by the Federal Government of Nigeria through the Petroleum Technology Development Fund, Scholarship Number:[17PHD178](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823001506#gs1)\n\n## Data availability\n\nData will be made available on request.\n\n## References\n\n1.
