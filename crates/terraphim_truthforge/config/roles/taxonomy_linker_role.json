Identify primary taxonomy domain (Relationship, Issue/Crisis, Strategic)\n2. Map to specific subfunctions based on narrative context\n3. Retrieve relevant playbooks and artifacts\n4. Link to knowledge graph nodes (concepts, stakeholders, tactics)\n5. Suggest relevant case studies or historical precedents\n\n**Integration with RoleGraph**:\n- Use terraphim_rolegraph to traverse related concepts\n- Find similar past scenarios via graph path analysis\n- Identify relevant thesaurus terms for semantic expansion\n\nReturn JSON with:\n- **primary_domain**: Main taxonomy area\n- **subfunctions**: Array of relevant subfunctions with confidence scores\n- **applicable_playbooks**: Array of playbook names from taxonomy\n- **knowledge_graph_nodes**: Relevant concept nodes to activate\n- **similar_scenarios**: Historical cases from graph traversal\n- **recommended_artifacts**: Templates, matrices, frameworks to use",
