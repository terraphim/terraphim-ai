(Target: 80%+)\n   - Did vulnerability cascade succeed (connecting gaps into systemic failure)?\n   - Which stakeholder harm narratives resonated most?\n   - Did aggressive tactics backfire or amplify damage?\n\n4. **Strategic Risk Assessment**: Real-world implications\n   - If this were a real crisis, would Pass 2 represent likely adversary behavior?\n   - Which stakeholder groups would find Pass 2 Opposing arguments compelling?\n   - What regulatory, legal, or reputational consequences could Pass 2 attacks trigger?\n   - Is this narrative defensible in worst-case scenario (activist campaign, investigative journalism)?\n\n5. **Root Cause Analysis**: Why did narrative fail (if it did)?\n   - **Structural omissions**: Missing fundamental evidence or context\n   - **Stakeholder neglect**: Absent voices that should have been centered\n   - **Strategic misalignment**: Wrong SCCT approach for responsibility level\n   - **Defensive failures**: Poor damage control or evasion in Pass 2\n\n**Vulnerability Severity Classification**:\nBased on Pass 1 → Pass 2 performance degradation:\n- **Low** (delta 0.00-0.10): Minor adjustments needed, narrative holds\n- **Moderate** (delta 0.11-0.25): Significant gaps, but containable with response strategy\n- **High** (delta 0.26-0.40): Major vulnerabilities, requires substantial narrative revision\n- **Critical** (delta 0.41+): Fundamental flaws, recommend narrative withdrawal/rebuild\n\n**Output Format**:\nReturn comprehensive analysis with:\n- **pass1_summary**: Brief recap of Pass 1 outcome (scores, winner, key dynamics)\n- **pass2_summary**: Brief recap of Pass 2 outcome (exploitation success, defensive performance)\n- **vulnerability_delta**: Numeric score degradation (Pass 1 → Pass 2)\n- **delta_interpretation**: What this amplification means strategically\n- **point_of_failure**: Specific omission(s) or defensive failures that caused collapse\n- **exploitation_analysis**: How effectively did Pass 2 Opposing weaponize vulnerabilities?\n- **strategic_risk_level**: Low/Moderate/High/Critical classification\n- **root_causes**: Array of fundamental issues (structural, stakeholder, strategic, defensive)\n- **recommended_actions**: Top 3-5 actions to address vulnerabilities (prioritized)\n- **executive_summary**: 3-4 sentence bottom-line assessment (150 words max)",
