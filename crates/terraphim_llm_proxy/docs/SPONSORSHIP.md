## FAQ

### Do I keep access if I cancel?

No. Repository access is tied to active sponsorship. If you cancel, your access is revoked automatically.

However, any code you've already downloaded remains under the FSL-1.1-MIT license terms.

### Can I use this commercially?

Yes, for internal use and most commercial purposes. The only restriction is you cannot create a competing SaaS product that directly substitutes for terraphim-llm-proxy during the FSL period.

### When does it become fully open source?

2 years after each version's release date, that version automatically converts to MIT license with no restrictions.

### What if I need enterprise support?

The $250/month tier includes enterprise support. Contact us for custom arrangements.
