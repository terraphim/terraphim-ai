# Slow & Cheap Routing

Slow & Cheap routing prioritizes cost savings above all other factors for background processing, batch operations, and non-urgent tasks. This scenario is designed for workloads where response time is not critical and budget optimization is the primary concern.

Slow & Cheap routing is triggered when:
- Cost-conscious requests mention "budget", "cheap", "economy", or "slow"
- Background batch processing can tolerate longer response times
- Non-urgent automation and maintenance tasks
- High-volume operations where cumulative cost matters most

Characteristics:
- Uses cost-effective DeepSeek Chat for maximum savings
- Optimized for batch processing and background jobs
- Accepts higher latency for significant cost reduction
- Perfect for non-interactive, cost-sensitive workloads
- Provides good quality while minimizing per-token costs

Use cases:
- Background data processing and analysis
- Batch content generation and summarization
- Cost-sensitive automation workflows
- Non-urgent maintenance tasks
- High-volume text processing operations
- Budget-constrained development environments
