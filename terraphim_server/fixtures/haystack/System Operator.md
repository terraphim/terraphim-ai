- [[Checklists]]
	- Name relationships between specific inputs, activities and outputs so that they make sense (produce valid statements) in the context. Are those relationship names make sense for generalized concepts? If they don't, can you explain why?
	- Can you propose how to measure the strength of those relationships, how strong are they as causal factors between inputs, activities, and outputs?
	- What elements of the process model are omitted in the text and are they important?
	- What wider concepts selected by Terraphim should be the part of the process model?

	- **Skill "System operation"**Â from the [[@INCOSE Competency Framework]]
		- Here, I want to explain how I performed [[Transition]], [[Operation]], and [[Maintenance]] processes of the production line for the X10 modular LED product R&D and launch, including the smart-lighting horticulture product line.
	- **Situation.**
		- I was [[Project manager R&D]] at the Production department of the S.-Petersburg plant Optogan in May 2011, planning operation and maintenance and executing these plans for 29 months. The production department of the plant paid for this production line installation, and our customer was the Chief process and production control engineer. We did this project for LED production line operators, process engineers, and field support engineers. All of them were operating the line in different aspects, which we considered in our plans and implemented downstream.
		- > *The situation is constructed from the information contained in the cvposition, startdate, duration, acquirer, customer, end-user, and topic attributes. It is well-suited to be put in one paragraph (30 seconds of response time).*
	- **Task.**
		- In the scope of this project, we were expected to:
		- plan for the operation of the production line equipment,
		- prepare technology process instructions and maintenance procedures,
		- set up chip- and wire-bonding equipment supply,
		- agree on and sign off warranty contracts,
		- acquire and modify QA laboratory equipment, and develop test procedures,
		- provide field support, develop maintenance instructions, and distribute repair kits.
		  First, we needed to extend the product catalog for the sales department with an additional product line of modular LEDs and intelligent lighting solutions for horticulture. Second, we needed to deploy operational equipment for the production floor at the plant. And finally, we needed to set up the whole supply chain for materials and equipment with the supply chain and manufacturing departments. As a final tangible result of the project, we were required to put into operation these assets - a new production line and QA laboratory test equipment.
		- > *The task structure is straightforward - it consists of end-user_material, affectedlocations, and affectedassets properties. Again, it is easily packed into one paragraph (here, you go into the second minute of the response time).*
	- **Actions.**
		- To plan and execute operations and maintenance, I worked closely with an R&D team, the manufacturing department, the supply chain department, and the Chief process and production control engineer. In the beginning, I clarified the cause of starting the project. The customer ordered it because this new ceramic modular LED (and following smart lighting for horticulture) required new production line equipment and maintenance contracts and procedures. Old equipment could not perform the required technological operations.
		- Together with stakeholders, we agreed that the project's primary goal was to plan and establish a new maintenance concept for the production line and horticulture product lines. We regularly revisited and updated this maintenance concept during the development, manufacturing, and transition, especially once the system became operational. There were a couple of drawbacks when trying to manage the heat management problem and proving the reliability with accelerated testing. Still, overall, the plan was solid, and we did not deviate from the baseline.
		- > *The structure of actions takes two paragraphs (response time reached the two-minute mark here), and we built it using participants, cause, goal, plan, and pivot attributes.*
	- **Results.**
		- All maintenance deliverables were successfully accepted by the customer. Please look at the project case with all the links [[X10 modular LED project]].
