# General Programming Concepts

This document covers general programming concepts without any specific tags.

## Variables and Data Types

Programming languages use variables to store data:
- Integers for whole numbers
- Strings for text
- Booleans for true/false values

## Control Flow

Programs need to make decisions and repeat actions:
- Conditional statements (if/else)
- Loops (for, while)
- Functions and procedures

## Error Handling

Robust programs handle errors gracefully:
- Try-catch blocks
- Error return codes
- Logging and debugging
