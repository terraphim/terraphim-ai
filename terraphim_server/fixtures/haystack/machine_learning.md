- [[Abstract]]
	- Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. This guide covers fundamental concepts, algorithms, and best practices for implementing ML solutions.
- [[Learning Paradigms]]
	- Supervised Learning: Learning from labeled data
	- Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
	- Reinforcement Learning: Learning optimal actions through trial and error
- [[Common Algorithms]]
	- Linear Regression
	- Logistic Regression
	- Decision Trees
	- Random Forests
	- Support Vector Machines
	- K-means Clustering
	- Neural Networks
- [[Evaluation Metrics]]
	- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
	- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
	- Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC)
	- Confusion Matrix
