- [[Abstract]]
	- Neural networks are computational models inspired by the human brain that can learn from data. They are the foundation of modern deep learning systems and have revolutionized fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning.
- [[Key Concepts]]
	- Neural networks consist of interconnected layers of artificial neurons or nodes
	- Each connection has a weight that can be adjusted during training
	- Learning occurs through backpropagation, which adjusts weights to minimize error
	- Activation functions introduce non-linearity, allowing networks to learn complex patterns
- [[Types of Neural Networks]]
	- Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN)
	- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
	- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
	- Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM)
	- Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
