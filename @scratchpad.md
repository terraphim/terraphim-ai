## COMPLETED: MCP Server Search Fix ✅

**Issue**: MCP integration was working (initialization successful) but returning empty results for validated queries like "testing" and "graph".

**Root Cause Identified**: MCP server was using `build_default_server()` which creates a "Default" role without knowledge graph configuration, while the desktop version uses `build_default_desktop()` which creates the "Terraphim Engineer" role with proper local KG setup.

**Solution Implemented**:
1. Modified `crates/terraphim_mcp_server/src/main.rs` to use `build_default_desktop()` instead of `build_default_server()`
2. Updated `desktop/src-tauri/src/main.rs` MCP server mode to use `build_default_desktop()` for consistency
3. Fixed imports in test file to resolve compilation issues

**Results**:
- ✅ All MCP integration tests pass
- ✅ Search queries now return proper results:
  - "terraphim-graph" → 2 documents
  - "graph embeddings" → 3 documents  
  - "graph" → 5 documents
  - "knowledge graph based embeddings" → 2 documents
  - "terraphim graph scorer" → 2 documents

**Technical Details**: 
- Desktop config builds thesaurus with 10 entries from `docs/src/kg/` local KG files
- Uses TerraphimGraph relevance function vs empty Default role
- Ensures consistent behavior between MCP server and desktop application modes

**Project Status**: ✅ COMPILING & WORKING
- Both Rust backend and frontend compile successfully
- MCP server now properly finds documents for Claude Desktop integration
- All validated test queries return expected results
