This is the beginning of an exciting great new journey: support open-source projects by donating or contributing.

Terraphim AI is partially supported by Innovate UK via the Eureka funding program up to 60% of costs, under grant 600594, "ATOMIC", jointly with our collaborators [Ontola](https://ontola.io/) - the team behind [Atomic Data Server and Protocol](https://atomicdata.dev/).
But for the rest of the costs, we need your help.

# Introducing a Donation-driven roadmap

After several months of agonising over which license to release Terraphim AI under, I created a new repository with the two most liberal licenses open source MIT and APACHE2. 
We may build a commercial service on top of Terraphim Core(Cortex), but the core and our promise that it is open-sourced to allow you all to build on top of Terraphim AI, with a privacy-first, building AI tooling right way around: you don't need to move your data. You codify and move your knowledge where it needs to be and helps you to get things done the most. 

# Donation-driven roadmap
To support the project's development, we introduce a "donation-driven roadmap": if you want a feature, vote for it not only with your thumb but with your money. 
In exchange:
* you will help us to shapre the feature -  we will be seeking your feedback on the feature implementation
* you will receive access to private repositories ahead of the public 
* you donation will help us to reward contributors and maintainers of the project

Sponsor the features on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/sponsors/terraphim) or propose a new idea in [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/orgs/terraphim/discussions)
