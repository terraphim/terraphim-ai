Knowledge work is fragmented across tools. We are building Terraphim to unify search across that mess without forcing you to upload your private data to cloud AI services.

## The Knowledge Fragmentation Problem

You remember reading a specific solution. You know it exists. But it is scattered across:

- local notes
- team docs
- code repositories
- public Q&A
- social technical threads

A local-first assistant is only useful if it can connect those sources in one place.

## The Privacy Dilemma

Most assistants solve search by centralizing your data on external servers.

Terraphim is designed to run locally. Your data stays on your machine.

## Why X Integration

Technical discussions happen in threads long before they become "official docs".

We want to index the specific X threads you care about into your local knowledge graph so they become searchable alongside your private notes.
