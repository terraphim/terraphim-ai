# Terraphim AI Assistant

Terraphim is a privacy-first AI assistant that works for you under your complete
control. It begins as a local search engine, which can be configured to search
for different types of content, such as StackOverflow, GitHub, and the local
filesystem with a pre-defined folder, including Markdown Files. We utilize
modern algorithms for AI/ML, data fusion, and distributed communication
techniques to operate AI assistants on the user's hardware, including unused
mobile devices.

It operates on local infrastructure and works exclusively for the owner's
benefit.

# Why Terraphim?

There are growing concerns about the privacy of data and the sharing of
individuals' data across an ever-growing list of services, some of which have a
questionable data ethics policy (e.g., Miro policy stated they could market any
user content without permission as of Jan 2020).

**Individuals** struggle to find relevant information in different knowledge repositories: [[1]](https://www.coveo.com/en/resources/reports/relevance-report-workplace),

personal ones like Roam Research/Obsidian/Coda/Notion, team-focused ones like
Jira/Confluence/Sharepoint, or public

# Why "Terraphim"?

Alex Mikhalev was inspired by the [Relict series][relict] of science fiction
novels by [Vasiliy Golovachev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasili_Golovachov),
where Terraphim is an artificial intelligence living inside a spacesuit (part of
an exocortex).
