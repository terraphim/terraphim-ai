# Terraphim AI Lessons Learned

## ðŸš€ OpenRouter Model Integration with Feature Guards - CURRENT PROJECT (2025-01-31)

### Project Overview

**Objective**: Implement OpenRouter model integration to provide AI-generated summaries instead of basic article descriptions, with proper feature flag guards for optional compilation.

**Key Innovation**: Feature-gated architecture that keeps the project lean while enabling optional AI capabilities for teams that need them.

### Strategic Approach: Feature-First Design

#### **Why Feature Guards Matter**
1. **Cost Control**: AI API calls cost money - feature must be explicitly enabled
2. **Binary Size**: Users without AI needs don't compile heavy dependencies
3. **Gradual Adoption**: Teams can choose when to enable AI features
4. **Compile-time Safety**: Feature availability checked at build time

#### **Architecture Decision: Conditional Compilation**
Instead of runtime feature toggles, using Rust's `#[cfg(feature = "openrouter")]` provides:
- Zero runtime overhead when disabled
- Compile-time guarantee of feature availability
- Clean separation of concerns
- No accidental API usage

### Technical Implementation Strategy

#### **Phase 1: Feature Flag Infrastructure**
```toml
[workspace]
[features]
default = []
openrouter = ["terraphim_service/openrouter", "terraphim_config/openrouter"]

[workspace.dependencies]
rig-core = { version = "0.5.0", optional = true }
```

**Key Insight**: Workspace-level feature coordination ensures consistent behavior across all crates.

#### **Phase 2: Role Configuration Enhancement**
```rust
#[cfg(feature = "openrouter")]
pub openrouter_enabled: bool,
#[cfg(feature = "openrouter")]
pub openrouter_api_key: Option<String>,
#[cfg(feature = "openrouter")]
pub openrouter_model: Option<String>,
```

**Key Insight**: Role-based configuration allows different teams to use different models and API keys.

#### **Phase 3: Service Implementation with Graceful Degradation**
```rust
#[cfg(feature = "openrouter")]
pub struct OpenRouterService { /* full implementation */ }

#[cfg(not(feature = "openrouter"))]
pub struct OpenRouterService; // stub implementation
```

**Key Insight**: Stub implementations ensure code compiles regardless of feature status.

### User Experience Considerations

#### **Feature Discovery**
- UI components detect feature availability at runtime
- Clear messaging when feature is disabled
- No confusing UI elements for unavailable features

#### **Configuration Management**
- OpenRouter settings only visible when feature is enabled
- API key management with secure storage
- Model selection with clear cost/performance tradeoffs

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

#### **API Cost Control**
1. Feature must be explicitly enabled during compilation
2. Role-level configuration required for activation
3. Rate limiting and content truncation to avoid runaway costs
4. Graceful fallback to existing descriptions

#### **Reliability**
1. Comprehensive error handling for API failures
2. Timeout management for long-running requests
3. Fallback logic maintains existing functionality
4. Content sanitization for API safety

### Model Selection Strategy

#### **Supported Models and Use Cases**
- `openai/gpt-3.5-turbo` - Development and testing (fast, affordable)
- `openai/gpt-4` - Production quality summaries (high cost, high quality)
- `anthropic/claude-3-sonnet` - Balanced performance (good middle ground)
- `anthropic/claude-3-haiku` - High-throughput scenarios (fast processing)
- `mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct` - Open source preference (cost-effective)

**Key Insight**: Different roles can use different models based on their needs and budgets.

### Development Workflow

#### **Build Configurations**
```bash
# Default build (no AI features)
cargo build

# Build with OpenRouter support
cargo build --features openrouter

# Test with OpenRouter
cargo test --features openrouter
```

**Key Insight**: Separate CI jobs for each feature configuration ensure compatibility.

### Key Takeaways for Future Features

1. **Feature Flags First**: Always consider optional compilation for non-core features
2. **Cost Awareness**: External API features require explicit user consent
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Maintain functionality when features are disabled
4. **UI Adaptation**: Interfaces should adapt to available features
5. **Clear Communication**: Users should understand what features are available
6. **Test Both Modes**: CI should validate enabled and disabled feature states

### Status

**Current Phase**: Feature Infrastructure Implementation
**Next Milestone**: Role configuration enhancement with feature guards
**Expected Completion**: Systematic implementation following planned phases
**Risk Level**: Low (feature-gated approach minimizes impact on existing functionality)

**Key Success Factor**: Maintaining the principle that AI features enhance rather than replace existing functionality, ensuring the system remains reliable and cost-effective for all users.
