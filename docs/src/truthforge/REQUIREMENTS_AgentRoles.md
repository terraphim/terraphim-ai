## Overview

This document defines the detailed specifications for all 12 specialized AI agent roles in the TruthForge Two-Pass Debate Arena. Each role is implemented as a `TerraphimAgent` with specific configurations, system prompts, quality criteria, and taxonomy mappings.

### Role Architecture

All roles follow the Terraphim-AI agent configuration pattern:

```rust
pub struct AgentRole {
    pub name: String,
    pub shortname: String,
    pub relevance_function: String,
    pub extra: AgentExtra,
}

pub struct AgentExtra {
    pub llm_provider: String,          // "openrouter" or "ollama"
    pub llm_model: String,              // Claude 3.5 Sonnet/Haiku or gemma3:270m
    pub system_prompt: String,          // Role-specific instructions
    pub agent_type: String,             // Agent classification
    pub quality_criteria: Vec<String>,  // Evaluation dimensions
    pub taxonomy_mapping: String,       // Function.subfunction from taxonomy
    pub temperature: f32,               // LLM creativity (0.0-1.0)
    pub max_tokens: u32,                // Response length limit

    "system_prompt": "You are an expert in cognitive psychology, critical thinking, and rhetoric. Your task is to analyze text for cognitive biases, logical fallacies, and rhetorical manipulation tactics.\n\nFor each piece of text, identify:\n\n1. COGNITIVE BIASES:\n   - Confirmation bias (selective evidence)\n   - Availability heuristic (overweighting recent/vivid examples)\n   - Anchoring (overreliance on first information)\n   - Framing effects (presentation influencing perception)\n   - Attribution bias (explaining others' actions vs. own)\n\n2. LOGICAL FALLACIES:\n   - Ad hominem (attacking person, not argument)\n   - Straw man (misrepresenting opponent's position)\n   - False dichotomy (presenting only two options)\n   - Slippery slope (exaggerating chain reactions)\n   - Appeal to authority/emotion/popularity\n   - Hasty generalization (insufficient sample size)\n\n3. RHETORICAL TACTICS:\n   - Loaded language (emotionally charged words)\n   - Weasel words (vague qualifiers)\n   - Euphemisms/dysphemisms\n   - Thought-terminating clichés\n   - Glittering generalities\n\nFor each identified issue, provide:\n- Type (bias/fallacy/tactic)\n- Specific instance (quote from text)\n- Severity (low/medium/high)\n- Alternative framing (neutral version)\n\nOutput as structured JSON with this schema:\n{\n  \"biases\": [{\"type\": \"...\", \"quote\": \"...\", \"severity\": \"...\", \"explanation\": \"...\", \"neutral_alternative\": \"...\"}],\n  \"fallacies\": [...],\n  \"tactics\": [...],\n  \"overall_assessment\": \"...\"\n}",

- **Severity Calibration**: 80% agreement with expert on severity levels
- **Alternative Quality**: Neutral alternatives are demonstrably less biased

**Test Scenarios**:

**Test 1: Confirmation Bias Detection**
```
Input: "Studies show that our product is safe. Experts agree that the risks are minimal. We've carefully selected the most reliable research to support our position."

    "severity": "high",

    "neutral_alternative": "We reviewed multiple studies with varying conclusions about product safety"
  }]
}
```

**Test 2: Ad Hominem Fallacy**
```
Input: "My opponent's criticism is invalid because they have financial ties to our competitors. Their analysis cannot be trusted."

Expected Output:
{
  "fallacies": [{
    "type": "ad_hominem",
    "quote": "criticism is invalid because they have financial ties to competitors",
    "severity": "high",

## Agent Interaction Patterns

### Pass 1 Workflow

```rust
// Sequential execution with data passing
let bias_analysis = BiasDetectorAgent::analyze(input_text).await?;
let narrative_map = NarrativeMapperAgent::analyze(input_text).await?;
let taxonomy_links = TaxonomyLinkerAgent::classify(input_text, narrative_map).await?;
let omissions = OmissionDetectorAgent::detect(input_text, bias_analysis, narrative_map).await?;

// Parallel debate execution
let (pro_debate, con_debate) = tokio::join!(
    Pass1DebaterAgent::argue_pro(input_text, bias_analysis, narrative_map, omissions),
    Pass1DebaterAgent::argue_con(input_text, bias_analysis, narrative_map, omissions)
);

// Evaluation
let pass1_eval = Pass1EvaluatorAgent::evaluate(pro_debate, con_debate, omissions).await?;
```

### Pass 2 Workflow

```rust
// Sequential exploitation debate
let exploitation_attacks = Pass2DebaterAgent::exploit(
    omissions,
    pass1_eval.vulnerable_omissions,
    pro_debate
).await?;

let defense_response = Pass2DebaterAgent::defend(
    omissions,
    exploitation_attacks,
    taxonomy_links.scct_classification
).await?;

// Cumulative evaluation
let cumulative_eval = CumulativeEvaluatorAgent::evaluate(
    pass1_eval,
    exploitation_attacks,
    defense_response
).await?;
```

### Response Generation Workflow

```rust
// Parallel response generation
let (reframe, counterargue, bridge) = tokio::join!(
    ReframeAgent::generate(cumulative_eval),
    CounterArgueAgent::generate(cumulative_eval, exploitation_attacks, defense_response),
    BridgeAgent::generate(cumulative_eval, omissions)
);
```

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests (Per Agent)

Each agent must have:
1. **Smoke test**: Agent creation with valid config
2. **Mock LLM test**: Agent execution with mock responses
3. **Error handling test**: Graceful handling of malformed inputs
4. **Config validation test**: Reject invalid role configurations

### Integration Tests

1. **Pass 1 workflow**: End-to-end execution with all Pass 1 agents
2. **Pass 2 workflow**: End-to-end with Pass 2 agents + Pass 1 results
3. **Response generation**: Parallel execution of 3 response agents
4. **Ollama compatibility**: All agents work with gemma3:270m (lower quality expectations)
5. **OpenRouter compatibility**: All agents work with Claude 3.5 Sonnet/Haiku

### Quality Tests

1. **Bias detection accuracy**: ≥85% precision/recall on benchmark dataset
2. **Omission identification**: ≥85% validity rate on expert-reviewed corpus
3. **SCCT classification**: ≥90% accuracy on labeled crisis communications
4. **Debate quality**: Expert ratings ≥7/10 on argument quality scale
5. **Response quality**: ≥80% of responses rated as "effective" or "very effective"

### Performance Tests

1. **Pass 1 latency**: Complete in <45 seconds (OpenRouter) or <20 seconds (Ollama)
2. **Pass 2 latency**: Complete in <30 seconds (OpenRouter) or <15 seconds (Ollama)
3. **Response generation**: <15 seconds (OpenRouter) or <8 seconds (Ollama)
4. **Total workflow**: <90 seconds (OpenRouter) or <45 seconds (Ollama)
5. **Cost per analysis**: <$5 for OpenRouter (Claude 3.5 Sonnet/Haiku mix)

---

## Agent Role Versioning

All agent roles follow semantic versioning:

- **Major version**: Breaking changes to role behavior or output schema
- **Minor version**: New capabilities added (backward compatible)
- **Patch version**: Bug fixes, prompt refinements, quality improvements

Current version: **1.0.0** for all roles (initial release)
