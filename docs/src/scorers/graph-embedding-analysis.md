# Terraphim Graph Embeddings vs Cleora

## 1. Terraphim Graph (Current Implementation)

### 1.1 Data structures
- `RoleGraph` (crate `terraphim_rolegraph`) maintains:
  - `nodes: HashMap<u64, Node>` – **concepts** (unique KG terms)
  - `edges: HashMap<u64, Edge>` – **co-occurrences** between concepts found while indexing documents
  - `documents: HashMap<String, IndexedDocument>` – corpus metadata
  - Aho-Corasick automaton for ultra-fast **exact synonym matching** _(O(text) streaming)_

### 1.2 Indexing / "Training"
1. Parse each document ➜ split sentences ➜ run AC ⇒ list of matched node-IDs.
2. For every consecutive pair `(x,y)` update edge weight.<br/>
   `edge.rank += 1` ; `node.rank += 1` ; `doc.rank += 1`.
3. Ranks therefore equal **frequency counts** (integer, monotonic).

### 1.3 Query & Ranking
```
score(document) = Σ(node.rank + edge.rank + doc.rank)  for all matches
```
- Results are sorted by the summed integer score and returned.
- All operations are in-memory, lock-free (`ahash`) and extremely fast for < ~1e5 nodes.
- **🆕 TF-IDF Enhancement**: For `TerraphimGraph` relevance function, documents are now re-scored using TF-IDF weighting (30% weight) combined with the original graph ranking, providing better semantic relevance while maintaining the fast graph-based foundation.

### 1.4 Strengths
✔  Zero-cost online updates (plain counters).
✔  Deterministic and explainable (frequency == relevance).
✔  Small memory footprint (no float vectors).
✔  **🆕 Hybrid TF-IDF scoring** improves semantic relevance while preserving graph structure benefits.

### 1.5 Limitations
✖  **No semantic smoothing** – synonyms outside thesaurus are unseen.
✖  **Ties & coarse granularity** – many docs share identical sums (partially addressed by TF-IDF).
✖  Ignores global topology (2-hop, motifs, community structure).
✖  Ranking deteriorates for long-tail terms with low frequency (partially addressed by TF-IDF).

## 2. Cleora (State-of-the-art Rust Graph Embeddings)
Cleora <https://github.com/Synerise/cleora> is an industrial-scale algorithm that:
1. Treats each relation as a separate sparse adjacency matrix.
2. Initialises node vectors with random values on the unit sphere.
3. Iteratively updates embeddings via **Chebyshev polynomial mixed context** (T iterations).
4. Provides **L2-normalised dense vectors** (128-512 dims) that capture multi-hop semantics.

Key properties:
- **Linear** in number of edges, multi-threaded (Rayon) – can embed 1B edges & 100M nodes.<br/>
- Produces **relation-specific** or joint embeddings.
- Written in pure Rust ➜ easy to vendor / build for WASM & native.

Performance (from paper / benchmarks):
- Hits@10 ↑ 5-25 % over Node2Vec / DeepWalk on standard datasets.
- Training 10× faster than PyTorch-GPU baselines on CPU-only hardware.

## 3. Comparative Analysis
| Aspect | Terraphim Graph | Cleora |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Representation | Integer rank counters | Float32 dense vectors |
| Captures multi-hop semantics | ❌ | ✅ (Chebyshev context) |
| Online updates | ✅ O(1) | ▲ requires re-embedding (mini-batch possible) |
| Memory | O(N+E) ints | O(N·d) floats (d≈128) |
| Search | Exact match + sum | ANN (cosine / dot) |
| Explainability | High (counts) | Medium (vector) |
| WASM compatibility | ✅ | ✅ (no `std::sync::atomic` in wasm32) |

---

## 4. Proposed Improvement Roadmap
1. **Hybrid Scoring** (Low effort)
   - Keep current frequency rank as **prior**.
   - Add optional Cleora cosine-similarity score `s_emb`.
   - Final score: `s = α · z_norm(rank) + (1-α) · s_emb` (α≈0.3 tuned on dev set).
2. **Offline Embedding Build Step**
   - New bin `cargo run -p terraphim_rolegraph --bin build-embeddings`.
   - Reads `thesaurus.json` ➜ generates `embeddings.bin` (NDArray).
   - Store in role config (`automata_path` sibling).
3. **Runtime Integration**
   - Load embeddings into `HashMap<NodeId, Vec<f32>>`.
   - On query:
     1. Fetch matched node IDs using AC _(unchanged)_.
     2. Average their vectors ➜ query embedding.
     3. HNSW/ANNOY search over pre-built vector index to retrieve top-k docs.
   - Merge with prior ranks.
4. **Incremental Updates** (Optional)
   - Schedule nightly re-embedding for changed subsets.
   - Or investigate **Cleora-streaming** branch (supports warm-start).
5. **Benchmark Suite**
   - Extend `rolegraph_knowledge_graph_ranking_test.rs` with MAP@10, nDCG using labelled queries.
   - Compare old vs hybrid vs pure Cleora.

### Quick Win
✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: TF-IDF weighted edge rank has been integrated into `RoleGraph::query_graph` improving differentiation and semantic relevance. The hybrid approach combines traditional graph ranking (70% weight) with TF-IDF scoring (30% weight) for better results.

---

## 5. Conclusion
Terraphim Graph offers lightning-fast, explainable ranking, but lacks deeper semantic awareness. Cleora complements this by encoding global graph structure into vectors. A hybrid approach retains Terraphim's speed while boosting recall & semantic relevance.

**✅ IMPLEMENTATION STATUS**: The first improvement from the roadmap has been successfully implemented. TF-IDF scoring is now integrated into the `TerraphimGraph` relevance function, providing:
- **Maintained Performance**: Original graph ranking logic preserved
- **Enhanced Relevance**: TF-IDF scoring (30% weight) improves semantic matching
- **Backward Compatibility**: No breaking changes to existing functionality
- **Validated**: All tests pass including the knowledge graph ranking tests

The implementation leverages the existing `TFIDFScorer` from `crates/terraphim_service/src/score/bm25_additional.rs`, demonstrating proper architecture and reuse of existing components.
