# Relationship between Aircraft and Crew

Here are some additional questions to consider when defining the relationships between aircraft and crew:

What is the relationship between an aircraft and its crew members? Is it a one-to-many relationship, where an aircraft has multiple crew members, but a crew member is only associated with one aircraft?
Can a crew member be assigned to multiple aircraft at the same time? If so, how would you represent this in the data model?
Can an aircraft have multiple crew members assigned at the same time? If so, how would you represent this in the data model?
Are there any specific roles or positions that a crew member can have on an aircraft (e.g. pilot, co-pilot, flight attendant, etc.)?
Are there any restrictions on the types of aircraft that a crew member can be assigned to (e.g. only certain types of aircraft, specific aircraft models, etc.)?
Are there any requirements for the qualifications or certifications that a crew member must have in order to be assigned to a particular aircraft?
Can crew members be reassigned to different aircraft or roles over time? If so, how would you track these changes in the data model?
Are there any requirements for the scheduling or rotation of crew members across different aircraft or duty times?
Are there any requirements for the training or familiarization of crew members with specific aircraft or systems?
Are there any regulatory or compliance requirements that need to be considered when defining the relationships between aircraft and crew?
Here is a checklist for relationships between aircraft and arrival:

Does an aircraft arrival correspond to a single aircraft or can an arrival be associated with multiple aircraft (e.g., a batch arrival)?
Is an arrival uniquely identified by a combination of flight number, departure airport, and arrival airport, or is there an additional identifier?
Does an arrival have a specific timestamp or time range associated with it (e.g., arrival time, arrival window)?
Is there a relationship between an arrival and a specific gate or seating area at the airport (e.g., arrival gate, seating assignment)?
Can an arrival be associated with a specific cargo or baggage transport (e.g., cargo manifest, baggage claim)?
Are there specific restrictions or requirements for aircraft arrivals (e.g., weather or air traffic control restrictions, specific parking arrangements)?
Are there specific procedures or protocols for handling aircraft arrivals?
