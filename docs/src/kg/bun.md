# Bun

Bun is a modern JavaScript runtime and package manager that aims to be a drop-in replacement for Node.js and traditional package managers.

Note: The Aho-Corasick matcher uses LeftmostLongest strategy, so "pnpm install" will match before "pnpm" alone, ensuring the most specific replacement wins.

synonyms:: pnpm, npm, yarn
