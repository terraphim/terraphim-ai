# Artifacts

Artifacts are verbatim evidence documents (reports, validation logs, etc.).

Policy:
- The canonical raw artifact is stored in `docs/artifacts/`.
- A rendered copy may exist under `docs/src/artifacts/` so it is readable on docs.terraphim.ai.

Case studies and reference docs should link to artifacts, not embed large logs inline.
