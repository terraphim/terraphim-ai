# scope: optional, can be anything (e.g., api, ui, config)
# description: imperative mood, lowercase, no period at end
#
# Examples:
# feat: add user authentication
# fix(api): resolve memory leak in handler
# docs: update README with installation steps
# chore(deps): bump tokio to 1.35.0
#
# Multi-line format (with body):
# feat: add user authentication
#
# This commit adds JWT-based authentication to the API.
# Includes login, logout, and token refresh endpoints.
